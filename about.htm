<h1>About This Project</h1>
<p>
This site is a collection of mathematical conjectures and related definitions, and theorems that come from related Wikipedia pages. 
Each conjecture is stored in a simple JSON format to make the data accessible,
searchable, and reusable by others.

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I’m Charles Glover, a mathematician and researcher interested in open mathematical
knowledge and data-driven exploration of conjectures. My profession is a Data Scientist at Booz Allen Hamiltion. 
This project began as an experiment in structuring and preserving open problems,
but it’s also a platform for collaboration and independent research.
