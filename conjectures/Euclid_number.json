  "summary": "A Euclid number is an integer of the form \\(E_{n}=p_{n}\\#+1\\), where \\(p_{n}\\#\\) is the primorial of the \\(n\\)-th prime number (the product of the first \\(n\\) prime numbers). These numbers are named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, in connection with his proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers. For example, the first few Euclid numbers are \\(3\\) (\\(2+1\\)), \\(7\\) (\\(2\\times 3+1\\)), and \\(31\\) (\\(2\\times 3\\times 5+1\\)). ",
