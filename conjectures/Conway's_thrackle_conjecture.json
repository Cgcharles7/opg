  "summary": "Conway's thrackle conjecture is a still-unsolved problem in graph theory that states any thrackle, a drawing of a graph where every pair of edges meets exactly once (either at a shared vertex or a proper crossing), can have no more edges than vertices. If true, this would imply that thrackleable graphs are relatively simple, with each connected component containing at most one cycle. ",
  "head": "A graph \\(G\\) has a drawing in the plane that is a thrackle (meaning every pair of edges meets exactly once, either at a common endpoint or a proper crossing).",
  "tail": "The number of edges of \\(G\\) is less than or equal to the number of its vertices (\\(|E(G)|\\le |V(G)|\\)). ",
