  "name": "Conway's thrackle conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrackle",
  "rephrased": "In any thrackle drawing (where edges meet exactly once at vertices or cross properly), the number of edges cannot exceed the number of vertices.",
  "implication_form": "If a graph can be drawn as a thrackle, then it must have at most as many edges as vertices.",
  "posed_by": "John Horton Conway",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 50,
  "explained": "Conway's thrackle conjecture states that any graph which has a thrackle drawing (a drawing in the plane where every pair of edges meets exactly once, either at a common endpoint or at a proper crossing) must satisfy the condition that the number of edges is at most the number of vertices. In other words, a thrackleable graph (one that admits a thrackle drawing) can have no more edges than vertices.",
