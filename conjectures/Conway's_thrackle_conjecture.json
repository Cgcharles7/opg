  "summary": "A thrackle is an embedding of a graph in the plane in which each edge is a Jordan arc and every pair of edges meet exactly once.  Edges may either meet at a common endpoint, or, if they have no endpoints in common, at a point in their interiors.  In the latter case, they must cross at their intersection point: the intersection must be transverse.\nA special case of thrackles, the linear thrackles, restrict the edges to be drawn as straight line segments. One method for constructing a linear thrac",
