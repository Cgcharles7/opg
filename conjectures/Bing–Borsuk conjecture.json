  "summary": "In mathematics, the Bing–Borsuk conjecture states that every \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n-dimensional homogeneous absolute neighborhood retract space is a topological manifold. The conjecture has been proved for dimensions 1 and 2, and it is known that the 3-dimensional version of the conjecture implies the Poincaré conjecture.",
