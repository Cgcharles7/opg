  "summary": "Hilbert's eleventh problem is one of David Hilbert's list of open mathematical problems posed at the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. A furthering of the theory of quadratic forms, he stated the problem as follows:\n\nOur present knowledge of the theory of quadratic number fields puts us in a position to attack successfully the theory of quadratic forms with any number of variables and with any algebraic numerical coefficients. This leads in particular to the inter",
