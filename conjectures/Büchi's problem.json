  "summary": "In number theory, B端chi's problem, also known as the n squares' problem, is an open problem named after the Swiss mathematician Julius Richard B端chi. It asks whether there is a positive integer M such that every sequence of M or more integer squares, whose second difference is constant and equal to 2, is necessarily a sequence of squares of the form (x + i)2, i = 1, 2, ..., M,... for some integer x. In 1983, Douglas Hensley observed that B端chi's problem is equivalent to the following: Does there",
