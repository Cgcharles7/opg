  "summary": "In mathematics, a quasiperfect number is a natural number n for which the sum of all its divisors (the sum-of-divisors function \n  \n    \n      \n        Ïƒ\n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma (n)}\n  \n) is equal to \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        n\n        +\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2n+1}\n  \n. Equivalently, n is the sum of its non-trivial divisors (that is, its divisors excluding 1 and n). No quasiperfect numbers have been found so far.\nThe quasiper",
