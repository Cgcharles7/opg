  "summary": "In mathematics, a partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation which involves a multivariable function and one or more of its partial derivatives.\nThe function is often thought of as an \"unknown\" that solves the equation, similar to how x is thought of as an unknown number solving, e.g., an algebraic equation like x2 âˆ’ 3x + 2 = 0. However, it is usually impossible to write down explicit formulae for solutions of partial differential equations. There is correspondingly a vast amount of mode",
