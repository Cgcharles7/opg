  "summary": "In commutative algebra, a field of mathematics, the monomial conjecture of Melvin Hochster says the following:\nLet A be a Noetherian local ring of Krull dimension d and let x1, ..., xd be a system of parameters for A (so that A/(x1, ..., xd) is an Artinian ring). Then for all positive integers t, we have\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        â‹¯\n        \n          x\n          \n            d\n          \n         ",
