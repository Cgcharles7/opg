  "summary": "In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, an \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n-dimensional manifold, or \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n-manifold for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n-dimensional Euclidea",
