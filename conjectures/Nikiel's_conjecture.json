  "name": "Nikiel's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikiel%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "A compact topological space can be mapped continuously onto a totally ordered set if and only if it is monotonically normal.",
  "implication_form": "If a compact topological space is monotonically normal, then it is the continuous image of a total order.",
  "posed_by": "Jacek Nikiel",
  "solved_by": "Mary Ellen Rudin",
  "year_originated": 38,
  "explained": "Nikiel's conjecture states that a compact topological space is the continuous image of a compact Hausdorff total order (i.e., a compact linearly ordered topological space) if and only if it is a monotonically normal space. This characterization was formulated by Jacek Nikiel in 1986 and proven by Mary Ellen Rudin in 1999. The conjecture provides a topological characterization (in terms of monotonic normality) of spaces that arise as continuous images of compact linear orders.",
