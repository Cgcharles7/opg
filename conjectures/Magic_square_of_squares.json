  "rephrased": "Is there a three-by-three magic square where every number is a perfect square?",

  "explained": "The Magic Square of Squares conjecture asks whether it is possible to construct a 3x3 magic square where all 9 elements are distinct perfect squares. A magic square is an arrangement of distinct numbers in a 3x3 grid such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals is the same, known as the magic constant. The conjecture specifically requires all elements to be perfect squares. Despite numerous attempts, no such magic square has been found, nor has it been proven impossible.",
