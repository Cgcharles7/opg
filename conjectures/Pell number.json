  "summary": "In mathematics, the Pell numbers are an infinite sequence of integers, known since ancient times, that comprise the denominators of the closest rational approximations to the square root of 2. This sequence of approximations begins ⁠1/1⁠, ⁠3/2⁠, ⁠7/5⁠, ⁠17/12⁠, and ⁠41/29⁠, so the sequence of Pell numbers begins with 1, 2, 5, 12, and 29. The numerators of the same sequence of approximations are half the companion Pell numbers or Pell–Lucas numbers; these numbers form a second infinite sequence t",
