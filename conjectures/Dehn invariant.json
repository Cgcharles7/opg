  "summary": "In geometry, the Dehn invariant is a value used to determine whether one polyhedron can be cut into pieces and reassembled (\"dissected\") into another, and whether a polyhedron or its dissections can tile space. It is named after Max Dehn, who used it to solve Hilbert's third problem by proving that certain polyhedra with equal volume cannot be dissected into each other.\nTwo polyhedra have a dissection into polyhedral pieces that can be reassembled into either one, if and only if their volumes an",
