  "explained": "Polignac's conjecture, proposed by Alphonse de Polignac in 1849, addresses the occurrence of prime gaps. It states that for any positive even number `n`, there exist infinitely many prime gaps of size `n`. This means that there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive prime numbers whose difference is exactly `n`. In formal terms, for any even `k`, the limit inferior of the `k`-th prime gap as the primes grow larger is `k`. Formally, for any even `k`, \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\inf g_n = k\\), where \\(g_n\\) is the gap between the \\(n\\)-th and \\((n+1)\\)-th prime.",
