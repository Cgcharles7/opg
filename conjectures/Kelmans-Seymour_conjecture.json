  "name": "Kelmans–Seymour conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelmans%E2%80%93Seymour_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "A highly connected graph that cannot be drawn on a plane without crossings must contain a subdivision of the complete graph K5.",
  "implication_form": "If a graph is 5-vertex-connected and non-planar, then it contains a subdivision of K5.",
  "posed_by": "Paul Seymour and Alexander Kelmans",
  "solved_by": "Alexander Kelmans",
  "year_originated": 46,
  "explained": "The Kelmans–Seymour conjecture states that every 5-vertex-connected graph that is non-planar contains a subdivision of the complete graph K5. In other words, if a graph is highly connected (specifically, 5-vertex-connected) and cannot be embedded in the plane without edge crossings, then it must contain a structure that resembles K5 with edges subdivided.",
