  "name": "Tammes problem",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammes_problem",
  "rephrased": "Arrange a given number of points on a sphere's surface such that the minimum distance between any two points is as large as possible.",
  "implication_form": "If you wish to maximize the minimum distance between points arranged on a sphere, then arrange them in the configuration that achieves this maximum distance.",
  "posed_by": "Pieter Merkus Lambertus Tammes",
  "solved_by": "Various configurations have been determined for small numbers of points (e.g., up to 120), but many cases remain unsolved.",
  "year_originated": "93",
  "explained": "The Tammes problem involves determining the optimal arrangement of a given number of points on the surface of a sphere such that the minimum distance between any two points is maximized. It is a discrete sphere packing problem focusing on maximizing the smallest pairwise distance for a fixed number of points. This problem is closely related to the concept of a spherical code, where the points represent codewords and the minimum distance corresponds to the minimum separation.",
