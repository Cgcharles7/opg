  "explained": "The isomorphism problem for Coxeter groups is the question of determining whether two given Coxeter groups, defined by their Coxeter diagrams, are isomorphic as abstract groups. This means deciding if a structure-preserving, one-to-one, and onto mapping exists between their elements. It is a difficult problem, as different generating sets can describe the same group, and even groups with the same properties might not be isomorphic. ",
