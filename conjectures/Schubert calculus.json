  "summary": "In mathematics, Schubert calculus is a branch of algebraic geometry introduced in the nineteenth century by Hermann Schubert in order to solve various counting problems of projective geometry and, as such, is viewed as part of enumerative geometry. Giving it a more rigorous foundation was the aim of  Hilbert's 15th problem.  It is related to several more modern concepts, such as  characteristic classes, and both its algorithmic aspects and applications remain of current interest. The term Schube",
