  "summary": "In mathematics, the Cartan–Hadamard conjecture is a fundamental problem in Riemannian geometry and geometric measure theory which states that the classical isoperimetric inequality may be generalized to spaces of nonpositive sectional curvature, known as Cartan–Hadamard manifolds. The conjecture, which  is named after French mathematicians Élie Cartan and Jacques Hadamard, may be traced back to work of André Weil in 1926.",
