  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime",
  "rephrased": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two with a prime exponent.",
  "implication_form": "If 2^n - 1 is prime, then n must be prime.",
  "posed_by": "Marin Mersenne",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 379,
  "explained": "A Mersenne number is defined as a number of the form Mn = 2^n - 1. A Mersenne prime is a Mersenne number that is prime. The key conjecture associated with this form is that the primality of Mn depends solely on the primality of n (i.e., if n is composite, then Mn is composite), which is not entirely proven but strongly supported. The main open question is whether there are infinitely many Mersenne primes.",
