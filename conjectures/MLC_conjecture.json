  "explained": "The Mandelbrot Set Locating Conjecture (MLC) posits that the Mandelbrot set is locally connected. This means that every point in the Mandelbrot set has a neighborhood that is entirely contained within the set and that the set is connected in a local sense. The conjecture is crucial because it relates to the connectivity of the Julia sets associated with points in the Mandelbrot set. Specifically, if the Mandelbrot set is locally connected, then the Julia set of a quadratic polynomial is connected if and only if the parameter is in the Mandelbrot set. Despite its fundamental importance, the MLC remains unproven.",
