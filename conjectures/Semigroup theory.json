  "summary": "In mathematics, a semigroup is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an associative internal binary operation on it.\nThe binary operation of a semigroup is most often denoted multiplicatively (just notation, not necessarily the elementary arithmetic multiplication): x ⋅ y, or simply xy, denotes the result of applying the semigroup operation to the ordered pair (x, y). Associativity is formally expressed as that (x ⋅ y) ⋅ z = x ⋅ (y ⋅ z) for all x, y and z in the semigroup.\nSem",
