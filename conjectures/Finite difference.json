  "summary": "A finite difference is a mathematical expression of the form f(x + b) − f(x + a). Finite differences (or the associated difference quotients) are often used as approximations of derivatives, such as in numerical differentiation.\nThe difference operator, commonly denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n  \n, is the operator that maps a function f to the function \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        [\n        f\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta [f]}\n  \n ",
