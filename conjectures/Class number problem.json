  "summary": "In mathematics, the Gauss class number problem (for imaginary quadratic fields), as usually understood, is to provide for each n â‰¥ 1 a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Q\n        \n        (\n        \n          \n            d\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} ({\\sqrt {d}})}\n  \n (for negative integers d) having class number n. It is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss. It can also be stated in terms of discriminants. T",
