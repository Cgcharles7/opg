  "summary": "In mathematics, in the field of algebraic number theory, a modulus (plural moduli) (or cycle, or extended ideal) is a formal product of places of a global field (i.e. an algebraic number field or a global function field).  It is used to encode ramification data for abelian extensions of a global field.",
