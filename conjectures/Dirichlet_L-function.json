  "summary": "A Dirichlet L-function is a complex function formed by extending the L-series, which is an infinite sum based on a Dirichlet character and a complex variable \\(s\\). It is a generalization of the Riemann zeta function that is crucial for understanding the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions.",
