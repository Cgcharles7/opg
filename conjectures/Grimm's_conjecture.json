  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Consecutive composite numbers can be covered by distinct primes.",
  "implication_form": "If there exists a sequence of n consecutive composite numbers, then there exists a set of n distinct primes, each dividing one of the composite numbers in the sequence.",
  "posed_by": "Carl Albert Grimm",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 55,
  "explained": "Grimm's conjecture states that for any sequence of k consecutive composite numbers, there exists a way to assign to each composite number a distinct prime divisor of that composite number.",
