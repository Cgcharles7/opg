  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_subspace_problem",
  "rephrased": "Does every continuous operator on a complex vector space with completeness (Banach space) have a subspace (other than zero or the whole space) that it maps to itself?",
  "implication_form": null,
  "posed_by": "Stefan Banach",
  "solved_by": "unsolved (for separable Hilbert spaces)",
  "year_originated": 94,
  "explained": "The Invariant Subspace Problem is a fundamental question in functional analysis. It asks whether every bounded linear operator T acting on a complex Banach space X has a non-trivial closed invariant subspace. In other words, is there always a closed subspace Y of X (other than {0} and X itself) such that T(Y) ⊆ Y?",
