  "summary": "In mathematics, the Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture is a conjecture relating étale cohomology to algebraic K-theory introduced by Quillen (1975, p. 175), who was inspired by earlier conjectures of Lichtenbaum (1973). Kahn (1997) and Rognes & Weibel (2000) proved the Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture at the prime 2 for some number fields. Voevodsky, using some important results of Markus Rost, proved the Bloch–Kato conjecture, which implies the Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture for all primes.",
