  "summary": "Graph pebbling is a mathematical game played on a graph with zero or more pebbles on each of its vertices. 'Game play' is composed of a series of pebbling moves. A pebbling move on a graph consists of choosing a vertex with at least two pebbles, removing two pebbles from it, and adding one to an adjacent vertex (the second removed pebble is discarded from play). Ï€(G), the pebbling number of a graph G, is the lowest natural number n that satisfies the following condition:  \n\nGiven any target or '",
