  "summary": "In topology and related branches of mathematics, a connected space is a topological space that cannot be represented as the union of two or more disjoint non-empty open subsets. Connectedness is one of the principal topological properties that distinguish topological spaces.\nA subset of a topological space \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is a connected set if it is a connected space when viewed as a subspace of \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displayst",
