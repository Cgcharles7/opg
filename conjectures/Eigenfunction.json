  "summary": "In mathematics, an eigenfunction of a linear operator D defined on some function space is any non-zero function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n in that space that, when acted upon by D, is only multiplied by some scaling factor called an eigenvalue. As an equation, this condition can be written as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n        f\n        =\n        λ\n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Df=\\lambda f}\n  \n\nfor some scalar eigenvalue \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n ",
