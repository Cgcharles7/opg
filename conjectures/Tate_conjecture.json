  "rephrased": "The Tate conjecture states that certain mathematical objects called 'algebraic cycles' on a geometric shape (variety) can be detected using simpler mathematical tools related to number theory and symmetry (Galois representations on étale cohomology).",
  "implication_form": "It is not possible to rephrase the Tate conjecture in the form 'If P, then Q' without knowing its exact statement.",
