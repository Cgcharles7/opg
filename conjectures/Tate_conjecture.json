  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The Tate conjecture states that certain mathematical objects called 'algebraic cycles' on a geometric shape (variety) can be detected using simpler mathematical tools related to number theory and symmetry (Galois representations on étale cohomology).",
  "implication_form": "It is not possible to rephrase the Tate conjecture in the form 'If P, then Q' without knowing its exact statement.",

  "year_originated": 60,
  "explained": "The Tate conjecture, proposed by John Tate in 1963, is a central problem in algebraic geometry that connects algebraic cycles on an algebraic variety to a more computable invariant, the Galois representation on its étale cohomology. It predicts that the cycle class map from algebraic cycles to Galois-equivariant cohomology is an isomorphism for varieties over a finite field. It is considered an arithmetic version of the Hodge conjecture. ",
