  "name": "Kato's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kato%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Does the square root of a uniformly complex elliptic operator, defined via functional calculus, have an analytic domain?",
  "implication_form": "If an operator is uniformly complex elliptic, then its square root (defined via functional calculus) has an analytic domain.",
  "posed_by": "Tosio Kato",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 71,
  "explained": "Kato's conjecture concerns the analyticity properties of the square root of certain types of elliptic operators. It posits that for a uniformly complex elliptic operator L (typically acting on vector-valued functions over a domain in R^n), defined on a bounded Lipschitz domain Ω, the square root √L (defined via functional calculus) is an analytic function on Ω. The precise statement often involves the boundedness and analyticity of the related Dirichlet-to-Neumann map or the Poisson operator associated with the operator L.",
