  "explained": "The Riemann Hypothesis is a conjecture about the Riemann zeta function, ζ(s), which is defined for complex numbers s = σ + it. The hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have real part exactly 1/2. Non-trivial zeros are those zeros that are not the negative even integers (trivial zeros). This means that if ζ(s) = 0 and s is not a negative even integer, then σ = 1/2. This conjecture is deeply connected to the distribution of prime numbers and is considered one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics.",
