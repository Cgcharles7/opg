  "name": "Section conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "For a curve defined over a number field, the existence of a certain connection (section) between its fundamental group and the Galois group of the base field implies that the curve has a rational point (a point with coordinates in the base field).",
  "implication_form": "If the homomorphism from the fundamental group of the curve to the Galois group of the base field has a section, then the curve has a rational point.",
  "posed_by": "Alexander Grothendieck",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 40,
  "explained": "The Section Conjecture, proposed by Alexander Grothendieck, posits a correspondence between the rational points of a curve and the \"sections\" of an exact sequence involving its arithmetic fundamental group and absolute Galois group. It states that the sections of the canonical projection from an arithmetic fundamental group to the absolute Galois group of the base field are in one-to-one correspondence with the rational points of the curve. This conjecture, still open, has significant implications for understanding the rational points on hyperbolic curves and their arithmetic.",
