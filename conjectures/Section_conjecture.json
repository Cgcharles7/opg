  "rephrased": "For a curve defined over a number field, the existence of a certain connection (section) between its fundamental group and the Galois group of the base field implies that the curve has a rational point (a point with coordinates in the base field).",
  "implication_form": "If the homomorphism from the fundamental group of the curve to the Galois group of the base field has a section, then the curve has a rational point.",
