  "rephrased": "A Riemannian manifold is called an Osserman manifold if the characteristic polynomial of its Jacobi operator is constant across all unit tangent vectors.",
  "implication_form": "If a Riemannian manifold has a constant characteristic polynomial for its Jacobi operator on the unit tangent bundle, then it is an Osserman manifold.",
  "posed_by": "Robert Osserman",

  "year_originated": 65,
  "explained": "An Osserman manifold is a Riemannian manifold (M, g) defined by the property that the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobi operator acting on the tangent space at each point is constant across all unit tangent vectors at that point. Formally, for each point p ∈ M, the Jacobi operator J: T_pM → End(T_pM) defined by J(v) = ∇_v ∇_v R(v, ⋅)⋅⋅⋅ (where ∇ is the Levi-Civita connection and R is the curvature tensor) has a characteristic polynomial det(λI - J(v)) that is independent of the unit vector v ∈ S(T_pM).",
