  "summary": "In mathematical logic, a theory is categorical if it has exactly one model (up to isomorphism). Such a theory can be viewed as defining its model, uniquely characterizing the model's structure.\nIn first-order logic, only theories with a finite model can be categorical.  Higher-order logic contains categorical theories with an infinite model.  For example, the second-order Peano axioms are categorical, having a unique model whose domain is the set of natural numbers \n  \n    \n      \n        \n     ",
