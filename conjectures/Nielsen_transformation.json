  "name": "Nielsen transformation",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_transformation",
  "rephrased": "Nielsen transformations are specific automorphisms of free groups that allow for the manipulation of group presentations, acting as a non-commutative analogue of row reduction operations on matrices.",
  "implication_form": "If a finite basis is given for a free group, then applying a sequence of Nielsen transformations to that basis results in another basis for the same free group.",
  "posed_by": "Originated by: Nielsen",
  "solved_by": "Unsolved",
  "year_originated": 100,
  "explained": "Nielsen transformations are a set of elementary operations that generate the automorphism group of a free group. The conjecture (or statement) regarding Nielsen transformations typically addresses the question of whether these elementary operations indeed generate all automorphisms of a free group of rank n. More precisely, it concerns the structure and generation of Aut(F_n) using Nielsen transformations. While the fact that elementary Nielsen transformations generate Aut(F_n) is a theorem proven by Jakob Nielsen, the exploration of this generation process and its properties remains a central topic in combinatorial group theory.",
