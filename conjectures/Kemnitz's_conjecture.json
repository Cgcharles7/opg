  "summary": "In additive number theory, Kemnitz's conjecture states that every set of integer lattice points in the plane has a large subset whose centroid is also a lattice point. It was proved independently in the autumn of 2003 by Christian Reiher, then an undergraduate student, and Carlos di Fiore, then a high school student.\nThe exact formulation of this conjecture is as follows:\n\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n be a natural number and \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      ",
