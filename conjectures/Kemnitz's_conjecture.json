  "explained": "Kemnitz's conjecture, formulated for the integer lattice Z^2 in two dimensions (n=2), states that for any finite set S of lattice points in the plane (points with integer coordinates), there exists a subset T ⊆ S with exactly 3 points (n+1=3) such that the centroid of T is also a lattice point. This means the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of the three points must both be integers. Equivalently, the sum of the x-coordinates and the sum of the y-coordinates of the three points must both be divisible by 3.",
