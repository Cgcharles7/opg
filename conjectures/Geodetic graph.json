  "summary": "In graph theory, a geodetic graph is an undirected graph such that there exists a unique (unweighted) shortest path between each two vertices.\nGeodetic graphs were introduced in 1962 by Ã˜ystein Ore, who observed that they generalize a property of trees (in which there exists a unique path between each two vertices regardless of distance), and asked for a characterization of them. Although these graphs can be recognized in polynomial time, \"more than sixty years later a full characterization is s",
