  "summary": "In mathematics, Kronecker coefficients gλμν describe the decomposition of the tensor product (= Kronecker product) of two irreducible representations of a symmetric group into irreducible representations. They play an important role in algebraic combinatorics and geometric complexity theory. They were introduced by Murnaghan in 1938.",
