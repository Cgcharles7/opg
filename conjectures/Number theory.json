  "summary": "Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and arithmetic functions. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of mathematical objects constructed from integers (for example, rational numbers), or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, algebraic integers). \nIntegers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations (Diophantine geometry). Questions in number theory can often be understood t",
