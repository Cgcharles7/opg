  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Mersenne_number",
  "summary": "The conjecture related to Catalan-Mersenne numbers is that the sequence of recursively defined Mersenne numbers starting from \\(M_{2}=3\\) produces primes \"up to a certain limit\", with the next term in the sequence after \\(M_{127}\\) expected to be composite. ",
  "head": "a number is a Catalan-Mersenne number", 
  "tail": "it is prime only for a finite number of terms in the sequence (likely only the first four terms: 3, 7, 127, and \\(2^{127}-1\\). ",
