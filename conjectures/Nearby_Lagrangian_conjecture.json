  "name": "Nearby Lagrangian conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearby_Lagrangian_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "In the context of symplectic geometry, the Nearby Lagrangian Conjecture suggests that any Lagrangian submanifold (a special type of submanifold) that is 'close' to the zero section (the base space itself) within a cotangent bundle can be smoothly deformed into the zero section using a specific type of path (called a Hamiltonian isotopy).",
  "implication_form": "If a closed exact Lagrangian submanifold exists within a cotangent bundle, then it is Hamiltonian isotopic to the zero section.",
  "posed_by": "Vladimir Arnold",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 1960,
  "explained": "The Nearby Lagrangian Conjecture, formulated by Vladimir Arnold in the 1980s, is a central open problem in symplectic topology. It states that any closed, exact Lagrangian submanifold within the cotangent bundle of a closed manifold (\\(T^{*}M\\)) must be Hamiltonian isotopic to the zero section. In simpler terms, it predicts that these submanifolds can be smoothly deformed to the \"flat\" zero section using a special kind of motion called a Hamiltonian isotopy. ",
