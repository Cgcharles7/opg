  "summary": "In graph theory, a strongly regular graph  (SRG) is a regular graph G = (V, E) with v vertices and degree k such that for some given integers \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n        ,\n        μ\n        ≥\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda ,\\mu \\geq 0}\n  \n\nevery two adjacent vertices have λ common neighbours, and\nevery two non-adjacent vertices have μ common neighbours.\nSuch a strongly regular graph is denoted by srg(v, k, λ, μ). Its complement graph is also strongly regular: it is an srg",
