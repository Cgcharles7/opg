  "summary": "In mathematics, the Ravenel conjectures are a set of mathematical conjectures in the field of stable homotopy theory posed by Douglas Ravenel at the end of a paper published in 1984. It was earlier circulated in preprint. The problems involved have largely been resolved, with all but the \"telescope conjecture\" being proved in later papers by others.
