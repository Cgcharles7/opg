  "name": "Rudin's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudin%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Rudin's conjecture states that the number of squares in a finite arithmetic progression with N terms, common difference q, and first term a is bounded by a function of N and q.",
  "implication_form": "If an arithmetic progression with N terms, common difference q, and first term a contains many squares, then the parameters N and q must satisfy a specific inequality.",
  "posed_by": "Walter Rudin",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 63,
  "explained": "Rudin's conjecture concerns the maximum number of perfect squares that can be contained in a finite arithmetic progression. Specifically, for given positive integers N (length of the progression), q (common difference), and a (first term), the conjecture states that the number of squares in the arithmetic progression starting at a with common difference q and containing N terms is bounded above by a function that grows no faster than a constant times (log N)^4, under certain conditions on q and a.",
