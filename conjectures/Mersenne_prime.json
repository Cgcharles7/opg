  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime",
  "rephrased": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written as 2 raised to the power of a prime minus one.",
  "implication_form": "If n is composite, then 2^n - 1 is composite.",
  "posed_by": "Marin Mersenne",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 400,
  "explained": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be expressed in the form 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. These primes are named after Marin Mersenne, who studied them. An important property is that if n is a composite number, then 2^n - 1 is also composite. Therefore, known Mersenne primes correspond to prime exponents n (though not all prime exponents yield Mersenne primes).",
