  "name": "Ganea conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganea_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The Lusternik-Schniremann category of the product space X × S^n equals the category of X plus one, for any positive integer n.",
  "implication_form": "If X is a topological space and n is a positive integer, then the category of X × S^n is equal to the category of X plus 1.",
  "posed_by": "Ganea (1978)",
  "solved_by": "Larry A. Smith (1983)",
  "year_originated": 45,
  "explained": "The Ganea conjecture, now known to be false, was a statement in algebraic topology regarding the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category (denoted as cat(X)). It claimed that for any topological space X and any positive integer n, the category of the product space X × S^n equals the category of X plus one. That is, cat(X × S^n) = cat(X) + 1 for all n > 0.",
