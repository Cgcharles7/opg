  "summary": "In formal language theory, the Kleene star (or Kleene operator or Kleene closure) refer to two related unary operations, that can be applied either to an alphabet of symbols or to a formal language, a set of strings (finite sequences of symbols).\nThe Kleene star operator on an alphabet V generates the set V* of all finite-length strings over V, that is, finite sequences whose elements belong to V; in mathematics, it is more commonly known as the free monoid construction.
