  "summary": "In mathematics, particularly in dynamical systems, the Hilbert–Arnold problem is an unsolved problem concerning the estimation of limit cycles of the dynamics of a flow on a sphere, and whether the number of such cycles can be bounded. A flow on a sphere means that you can imagine that the velocities of particles are prescribed, and a limit cycle is a limit of those velocities, like the Gulf Stream on the globe. The problem asks whether in a generic family of smooth vector fields, smoothly param",
