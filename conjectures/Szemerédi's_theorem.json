  "name": "Szemerédi's theorem",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szemer%C3%A9di%27s_theorem",
  "rephrased": "If a subset of the integers has positive density, then it contains arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length.",
  "implication_form": "If a subset of the integers has positive natural density, then it contains a k-term arithmetic progression for every k.",
  "posed_by": "Paul Erdős and Pál Turán",
  "solved_by": "Endre Szemerédi",
  "year_originated": 1936,
  "explained": "Szemerédi's theorem states that any subset of the integers with positive upper density contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. In other words, if a subset A of the integers has positive density (a concept rigorously defined in additive combinatorics), then for any integer k, A contains a k-term arithmetic progression.",
