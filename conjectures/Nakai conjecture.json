  "summary": "In mathematics, the Nakai conjecture is an unproven characterization of smooth algebraic varieties, conjectured by Japanese mathematician Yoshikazu Nakai in 1961.\nIt states that if V is a complex algebraic variety, such that its ring of differential operators is generated by the derivations it contains, then V is a smooth variety. The converse statement, that smooth algebraic varieties have rings of differential operators that are generated by their derivations, is a result of Alexander Grothend",
