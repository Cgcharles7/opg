  "summary": "In topology and related branches of mathematics, a topological space is called locally compact if, roughly speaking, each small portion of the space looks like a small portion of a compact space. More precisely, it is a topological space in which every point has a compact neighborhood. \nWhen locally compact spaces are Hausdorff they are called locally compact Hausdorff, which are of particular interest in mathematical analysis.",
