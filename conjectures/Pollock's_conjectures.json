  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollock%27s_conjectures",
  "rephrased": "Every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of at most three three-dimensional figurate numbers (such as tetrahedral numbers or octahedral numbers).",
  "implication_form": "If a positive integer can be expressed as the sum of three three-dimensional figurate numbers, then every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of at most three three-dimensional figurate numbers (though this is circular and not a standard implication form for the conjecture).",
  "posed_by": "Frederick Pollock",

  "year_originated": 174,
  "explained": "Pollock's conjectures are two related statements in additive number theory regarding the representation of integers using three-dimensional figurate numbers.\n\nConjecture 1: Every positive integer greater than 946 can be expressed as the sum of at most three three-dimensional figurate numbers (more specifically, triangular pyramidal numbers or tetrahedral numbers).\n\nConjecture 2: Every positive integer greater than 21 is a sum of at most three three-dimensional square pyramidal numbers.",
