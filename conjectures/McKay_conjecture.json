  "explained": "The McKay conjecture, formulated by John McKay, asserts that for any finite group G and any prime number p, the number of irreducible complex characters of G whose degrees are not divisible by p is equal to the number of irreducible complex characters of the normalizer N_G(P) of any Sylow p-subgroup P of G whose degrees are not divisible by p. In other words, | Irr(G | p') | = | Irr(N_G(P) | p') |, where p' denotes that the degree is coprime to p.",
