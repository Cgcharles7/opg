  "summary": "In mathematics, the Bernoulli numbers Bn are a sequence of rational numbers which occur frequently in analysis. The Bernoulli numbers appear in (and can be defined by) the Taylor series expansions of the tangent and hyperbolic tangent functions, in Faulhaber's formula for the sum of m-th powers of the first n positive integers, in the Eulerâ€“Maclaurin formula, and in expressions for certain values of the Riemann zeta function.\nThe values of the first 20 Bernoulli numbers are given in the adjacent",
