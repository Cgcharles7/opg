  "rephrased": "An NSW prime is a prime number that appears as a term in the sequence defined by S_0 = 2, S_1 = 7, and S_n = 2*n*S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} for n ≥ 2.",
  "implication_form": "If a term in the sequence defined by S_0 = 2, S_1 = 7, and S_n = 2*n*S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} is prime, then it is an NSW prime.",
  "posed_by": "Newman, Shanks, Williams",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 1969,
  "explained": "A Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime is a prime number that appears in the sequence defined by the recurrence relation S_n = 6 * S_{n-1} - S_{n-2}, with initial conditions S_0 = 1 and S_1 = 5. The sequence begins: 1, 5, 29, 169, 985, ... The primes in this sequence are called NSW primes. The conjecture aspect relates to the characterization of primes through this specific sequence, particularly concerning the infinitude of NSW primes or their properties beyond the definition.",
