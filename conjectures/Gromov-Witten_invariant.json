  "rephrased": "Gromov–Witten invariants are numbers that count the number of special curves (pseudoholomorphic curves) passing through specific points or curves in a symplectic manifold.",
  "implication_form": "If a symplectic manifold satisfies certain conditions, then its Gromov–Witten invariants can be defined and can be used to distinguish it from other symplectic manifolds.",

  "explained": "Gromov–Witten (GW) invariants are numerical invariants associated to a symplectic manifold or algebraic variety. They count the number of curves (more precisely, pseudoholomorphic curves) that intersect a given set of codimension-two cycles (or satisfy other conditions) and satisfy certain boundary conditions. The formal definition is often given through axioms, typically involving a homology class (or insertions) and specifying the genus and target space. These counts are weighted by the Euler class of the moduli space of stable curves and are formal power series or numbers. The axiomatic definition includes properties like gluing axioms, stationary axioms, and divisor axioms, which ensure consistency and allow for recursive computation. Alternatively, they can be defined via the quantum cohomology ring structure.",
