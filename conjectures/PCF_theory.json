  "summary": "Pcf theory is the name of a mathematical theory, introduced by Saharon Shelah (1978), that deals with the cofinality of the ultraproducts of ordered sets. It gives strong upper bounds on the cardinalities of power sets of singular cardinals, among other applications. The abbreviation \"pcf\" stands for \"possible cofinalities\".",
