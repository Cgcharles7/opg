  "summary": "In mathematics, Selberg's conjecture, also known as Selberg's eigenvalue conjecture, conjectured by Selberg (1965, p. 13), states that the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on Maass wave forms of congruence subgroups are at least 1/4. Selberg showed that the eigenvalues are at least 3/16. Subsequent works improved the bound, and the best bound currently known is 975/4096≈0.238..., due to Kim & Sarnak (2003).\nThe generalized Ramanujan conjecture for the general linear group implies Selberg's co",
