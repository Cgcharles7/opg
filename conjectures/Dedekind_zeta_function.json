  "summary": "A Dedekind zeta function is a generalization of the Riemann zeta function to algebraic number fields, encoding information about the primes and ideals within that field. It is defined as a Dirichlet series that sums the absolute norms of all integral ideals in a number field, and it can be extended to a meromorphic function on the complex plane with a single pole at \\(s=1\\)",
