  "summary": "The Demazure conjecture, which was posed in 1974 and is now a proven theorem, is a result in representation theory concerning representations of algebraic groups. It implies that certain formulas for representations, particularly the Demazure character formula, can be extended from complex groups to other fields and over the integers. The work was extended to all reductive algebraic groups by other mathematicians. ",
  "head": "\\(P\\) (the field is of characteristic zero)", 
  "tail": "\\(Q\\) (the results, such as the vanishing of higher cohomology groups for line bundles on Schubert varieties and the character formula, hold for fields of arbitrary characteristic or over the integers).",
