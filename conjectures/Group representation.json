  "summary": "In the mathematical field of representation theory, group representations describe abstract groups in terms of bijective linear transformations of a vector space to itself (i.e. vector space automorphisms); in particular, they can be used to represent group elements as invertible matrices so that the group operation can be represented by matrix multiplication.\nIn chemistry, a group representation can relate mathematical group elements to symmetric rotations and reflections of molecules.\nRepresen",
