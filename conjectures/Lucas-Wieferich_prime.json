  "name": "Lucas–Wieferich prime",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wieferich_prime",
  "rephrased": "A Lucas–Wieferich prime is a prime number that satisfies a specific condition related to Lucas sequences and is analogous to the concept of a Wieferich prime.",
  "implication_form": "If a prime satisfies the Lucas–Wieferich condition, then it is a Lucas–Wieferich prime.",
  "posed_by": "Arthur Wieferich (in the context of Fermat's Last Theorem, though the specific Lucas–Wieferich concept may have been formalized later)",
  "solved_by": "Unsolved",
  "year_originated": 1909,
  "explained": "A Wieferich prime is a prime number p such that p² divides 2^{p-1} - 1. This condition is stronger than Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any odd prime p, p divides 2^{p-1} - 1. Wieferich primes were first described by Arthur Wieferich in 1909 in works pertaining to Fermat's Last Theorem. There are only two known Wieferich primes: 1093 and 3511.",
