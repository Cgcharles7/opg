  "name": "Road coloring conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_coloring_theorem",
  "rephrased": "Is there a finite sequence of labels (colors) that can be used to reach a specific node from any starting point in a finite, strongly connected directed graph where each vertex has equal in-degree and out-degree?",
  "implication_form": "If the graph is Eulerian (each vertex has equal in-degree and out-degree) and strongly connected, then there exists a finite sequence of labels (a synchronizing word) that, regardless of the starting node, leads to a specific target node.",
  "posed_by": "Victor Klee",
  "solved_by": "Anisohlar, Beža, Kambites, Trakhtenbrot",
  "year_originated": 47,
  "explained": "The Road Coloring Conjecture states that any strongly connected, aperiodic directed graph with a finite number of vertices possesses a universal edge-coloring (assigning colors to edges). This coloring has the property that, from any starting vertex, following a specific sequence of instructions (based on the color sequence) leads unambiguously to a designated target vertex, regardless of the initial position.",
