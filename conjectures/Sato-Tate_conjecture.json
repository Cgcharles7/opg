  "rephrased": "The number of points on elliptic curves modulo primes follows a specific statistical pattern.",
  "implication_form": "If an elliptic curve is reduced modulo a prime, then the distribution of the number of points relates to the distribution of an angle θ.",

  "explained": "The Sato–Tate conjecture pertains to elliptic curves defined over the rational numbers. For an elliptic curve E defined over the rationals, one considers its reductions modulo prime numbers p. Let Np be the number of points on this reduced curve Ep over the finite field with p elements. Hasse's theorem states that Np = p + 1 - a_p, where a_p is an integer satisfying |a_p| ≤ 2√p. The conjecture provides a probabilistic description for the distribution of the normalized value a_p / √p as p varies over sufficiently large primes. Specifically, it posits that the sequence {θ_p} defined by a_p = 2√p cos(θ_p) is equidistributed with respect to the Haar measure on the Sato–Tate group, which for most elliptic curves is a compact subgroup of SU(2). In other words, the fractional parts {θ_p / (2π)} become uniformly distributed in the interval [0,1) as p runs through primes.",
