  "explained": "Map folding refers to the problem of counting the number of distinct ways a piece of paper can be folded, where the paper is divided by creases and all folds must occur along these creases. There are two main variants: the stamp folding problem, which involves folding a strip of stamps (each a unit square) separated by creases, and the map folding problem, which involves folding a map (typically a rectangular grid of smaller rectangles) along its creases. The folding sequences must result in a compact shape, often a single point or a small area, and different sequences or resulting shapes are considered distinct foldings.",
