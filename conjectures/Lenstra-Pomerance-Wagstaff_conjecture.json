  "rephrased": "The Lenstra–Pomerance–Wagstaff conjecture states that there are infinitely many Sophie Germain primes, which are primes p such that 2p + 1 is also prime.",
  "implication_form": "If p is prime and 2p + 1 is prime (i.e., p is a Sophie Germain prime), then there exist infinitely many such primes.",

  "year_originated": 1982,
  "explained": "The Lenstra–Pomerance–Wagstaff (LPW) conjecture addresses the density of Mersenne primes. It proposes a conjectural asymptotic estimate for the number of Mersenne primes less than a given bound x. The conjecture is based on the connection between Mersenne numbers (M_p = 2^p - 1 for prime p) and certain prime factors called Germain primes (or Sophie Germain primes). It conjectures that the number of primes p (called 'good' primes in this context) for which 2p + 1 divides the Mersenne number M_p is approximately c * x / (log x)^2, where c is a positive constant. This density is analogous to the conjectured density of Sophie Germain primes themselves, as stated in the Bateman–Horn conjecture.",
