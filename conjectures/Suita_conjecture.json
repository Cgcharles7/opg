  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suita_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "On a Riemann surface with a nontrivial Green function, the Bergman kernel function satisfies a specific inequality involving the derivative of the Green function.",
  "implication_form": "If a Riemann surface admits a nontrivial Green function, then its Bergman kernel function is bounded above by a constant times the reciprocal of the derivative of the Green function.",
  "posed_by": "Shigeyuki Suita",
  "solved_by": "Takuro Ohsawa (2017)",
  "year_originated": 51,
  "explained": "Suita (1972): Let R be a Riemann surface, which admits a nontrivial Green function G_R. Let Ω be a subdomain of R with piecewise smooth boundary. Let ω be a point on the boundary of Ω. Then, for any holomorphic function f defined in a neighborhood of ω, the following inequality holds: |f'(ω)| ≤ (π / G_R(ω)) * ∫∫_Ω |f(z)|^2 dA(z), where dA denotes the area element.",
