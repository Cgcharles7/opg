  "rephrased": "The only consecutive integers that are both perfect powers (powers of exponent greater than one) are 8 and 9.",

  "explained": "Pillai's conjecture, also known as the Catalan–Pillai conjecture, is a conjecture in number theory. It states that for the equation |x^a - y^b| = 1 (where a, b > 1 and x, y are positive integers), the only solutions occur when one of the exponents is 1 or when the equation is a trivial case involving consecutive integers (like 3^2 = 9 and 2^3 = 8, which differ by 1, or 1^n and 0^m). In other words, the only time a perfect power differs from another perfect power by 1 is when one of the exponents is 1 (making it a prime power or higher power) or in the trivial cases.",
