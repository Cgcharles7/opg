  "name": "Jordan curve",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve",
  "rephrased": "A simple closed curve divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior.",
  "implication_form": "If a curve is a simple closed curve in the plane, then it divides the plane into two regions.",
  "posed_by": "Camille Jordan",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 1887,
  "explained": "The Jordan curve theorem states that every simple closed curve in the plane divides the plane into two regions: one bounded interior region and one unbounded exterior region, and the curve itself is the boundary between them. More formally, if J is a Jordan curve (a continuous, simple closed curve, i.e., a homeomorphism from the circle S¹ to R²), then R²\\J is disconnected and has exactly two connected components: one bounded and one unbounded.",
