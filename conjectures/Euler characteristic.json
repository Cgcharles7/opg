  "summary": "In mathematics, and more specifically in algebraic topology and polyhedral combinatorics, the Euler characteristic (or Euler number, or Euler–Poincaré characteristic) is a topological invariant, a number that describes a topological space's shape or structure regardless of the way it is bent. It is commonly denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        χ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\chi }\n  \n (Greek lower-case letter chi).\nThe Euler characteristic was originally defined for polyhedra and used to prove v",
