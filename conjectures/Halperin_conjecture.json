  "name": "Halperin conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halperin_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "In rational homotopy theory, the Halperin conjecture proposes a relationship between the rank of the fundamental group of a space and its rational homotopy properties, specifically in the context of fibrations where the base space is simply connected.",
  "implication_form": "If a space X is the total space of a fibration with a simply connected base space, then the rank of its fundamental group is bounded by its rational homotopy properties.",
  "posed_by": "Stephen Halperin",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 40,
  "explained": "The Halperin conjecture, formulated by Stephen Halperin in the context of rational homotopy theory, addresses the rank of the differential in the Serre spectral sequence for certain fibrations. Specifically, for a fibration F → X → B where X is simply connected and the spectral sequence converges to the rational homotopy of X, the conjecture states that the rank of the differential d₂ in the minimal model associated to the fibration is equal to the dimension of the rational homotopy Lie algebra of F minus the rank of the rational homotopy Lie algebra of B.",
