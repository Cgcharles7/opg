  "summary": "The Ahlfors conjecture, which is now a theorem in mathematics, asserts that the limit set of a finitely produced Kleinian group has measure 0 or is the whole Riemann sphere.<br><br>Lars Ahlfors presented the conjecture and proved it in the case where the fundamental domain of the Kleinian group has a finite number of sides [1]. Marden's tameness conjecture, which states that hyperbolic 3-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental groups are topologically tame (homeomorphic to the interior of compact 3-manifolds), leads to the Ahlfors conjecture for topologically tame groups, which Richard Canary proved by demonstrating that a topologically tame Kleinian group is geometrically tame [2]. Danny Calegari and David Gabai [4] and Ian Agol [3] independently proved this latter conjecture.",
