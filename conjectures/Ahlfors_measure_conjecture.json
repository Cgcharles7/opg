  "name": "Ahlfors measure conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahlfors_measure_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The limit set of a finitely generated Kleinian group is either 'small' (measure zero) or covers the entire complex plane.",
  "implication_form": "If a Kleinian group has a finite-sided fundamental domain, then its limit set has measure 0 or is the whole Riemann sphere.",
  "posed_by": "Lars Ahlfors",
  "solved_by": "Richard Canary, Ian Agol, Danny Calegari, David Gabai",
  "year_originated": 58,
  "explained": "The Ahlfors Measure Conjecture, now a theorem, states that for any finitely generated Kleinian group, the limit set (the set of accumulation points of the orbit of any point under the group action) has either measure zero with respect to the spherical Lebesgue measure or is the entire Riemann sphere. Lars Ahlfors proved this for the specific case where the fundamental domain has a finite number of sides. The general proof relies on the connection between topological tameness and geometric tameness established by Marden's Tameness Conjecture, with the final step provided by independent proofs from Agol, Calegari & Gabai.",
