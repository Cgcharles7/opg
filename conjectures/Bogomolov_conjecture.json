  "name": "Bogomolov conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogomolov_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Points with very small 'height' (a measure of complexity) on certain subvarieties of abelian varieties are rare; only specific 'special' subvarieties, like those defined by rational equations or containing torsion points, can host infinitely many such points in a 'dense' way.",
  "implication_form": "If a subvariety of an abelian variety contains a Zariski-dense set of points with canonical height zero, then it must be a special (or torsion) subvariety.",
  "posed_by": "French mathematician Frédéric Bogomolov",
  "solved_by": "Unsolved in general, but proven in many special cases (e.g., by M. Raynaud, D. Cantor, G. Faltings, J. Harris, R. Lange, M. Hindry, J. Bost, J. Loir, etc.)",
