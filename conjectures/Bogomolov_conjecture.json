  "summary": "The Bogomolov conjecture is a statement in number theory about the distribution of \"small height\" points on algebraic varieties, such as curves or abelian varieties. It essentially states that if a subvariety is not a \"special\" (or torsion) subvariety, then it cannot contain a Zariski-dense set of points with small height. The conjecture has two main versions: one for curves and one for higher-dimensional varieties, and both have been proven in many cases. ",
  "head": "Let \\(X\\) be an irreducible subvariety of an abelian variety \\(A\\) over a number field (or function field), and assume that \\(X\\) contains a Zariski-dense set of points with canonical height zero (or, more generally, \"small height\"). ",
