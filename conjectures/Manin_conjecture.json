  "summary": "In mathematics, the Manin conjecture describes the conjectural distribution of rational points on an algebraic variety relative to a suitable height function. It was proposed by Yuri I. Manin and his collaborators in 1989 when they initiated a program with the aim of describing the distribution of rational points  on suitable algebraic varieties.",
