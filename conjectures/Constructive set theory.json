  "summary": "Axiomatic constructive set theory is an approach to mathematical constructivism following the program of axiomatic set theory.\nThe same first-order language with \"\n  \n    \n      \n        =\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle =}\n  \n\" and \"\n  \n    \n      \n        âˆˆ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\in }\n  \n\" of classical set theory is usually used, so this is not to be confused with a constructive types approach.\nOn the other hand, some constructive theories are indeed motivated by their interpretability",
