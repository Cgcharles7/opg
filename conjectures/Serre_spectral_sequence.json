  "rephrased": "The Serre spectral sequence is a powerful tool in algebraic topology that allows the homology groups of the total space of a fibration to be computed from the homology groups of its base space and fiber.",
  "implication_form": "If there exists a Serre fibration, then the Serre spectral sequence provides a way to compute the homology of the total space from the homology of the base space and the fiber.",

  "year_originated": 70,
  "explained": "The Serre spectral sequence is a fundamental tool in algebraic topology, not a conjecture but a theorem established by Jean-Pierre Serre. It provides a way to compute the homology or cohomology of the total space of a **Serre fibration** (a continuous map with certain homotopy lifting properties) given the homology/cohomology of the base space and the fiber. The sequence is a powerful computational device expressed in the language of spectral sequences, which are tools for computing derived functors in homological algebra. It typically starts with information about the base space and fiber and converges to the homology/cohomology of the total space. Serre's work on this sequence was a major achievement that earned him the Fields Medal.",
