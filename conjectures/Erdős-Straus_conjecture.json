  "summary": "The Erdős–Straus conjecture is an unproven statement in number theory that proposes that for every integer \\(n\\ge 2\\), the fraction \\(4/n\\) can be expressed as the sum of three unit fractions, meaning there exist positive integers \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that:\\(\\frac{4}{n}=\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}+\\frac{1}{z}\\) ",
  "head": "\\(n\\) is an integer such that \\(n\\ge 2\\)", 
  "tail": "there exist positive integers \\(x,y,\\) and \\(z\\) such that the equation \\(\\frac{4}{n}=\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}+\\frac{1}{z}\\) holds. ",
