  "rephrased": "A Lyapunov function is a scalar-valued function used to determine the stability of an equilibrium point in a system of ordinary differential equations by ensuring the function decreases along solutions of the system.",
  "implication_form": "If a continuously differentiable function exists that is positive definite at the equilibrium point and its derivative is negative semi-definite, then the equilibrium point is stable.",

  "explained": "In the theory of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and dynamical systems, a Lyapunov function (or Lyapunov's function or Lyapun. function) is a scalar function defined on a set containing an equilibrium point of an autonomous system. If this function satisfies certain conditions, it can be used to prove the stability (Lyapunov stability) of that equilibrium point. Specifically, a continuously differentiable function V(x) is a Lyapunov function for an equilibrium point (typically the origin) if: 1) V(x) is positive definite (V(x) > 0 for all x ≠ 0, and V(0) = 0), and 2) The time derivative of V along the trajectories of the system, V̇(x) = ∇V(x) · f(x), is negative semi-definite (V̇(x) ≤ 0 for all x). If V̇(x) is negative definite (V̇(x) < 0 for all x ≠ 0), then the equilibrium is asymptotically stable. The concept generalizes to Markov chains as a Foster-Lyapunov function for proving positive recurrence and stability.",
