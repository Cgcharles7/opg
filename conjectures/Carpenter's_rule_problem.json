  "summary": "The Carpenter's Rule problem refers to two main geometric problems: whether a polygonal chain can be continuously and smoothly \"straightened\" without self-intersection, and finding the minimum length into which a chain of hinged segments can be folded (the \"folding problem\"). The \"straightening\" problem has been solved, proving any open polygonal chain can be flattened. The \"folding\" problem, which is NP-complete, asks if a ruler can be folded into a given length.",
  "head": "a collection of non-intersecting polygonal arcs and simple polygons in the plane has rigid edges and hinged vertices (a linkage)",  
  "tail": "then there exists a continuous motion (an expansive motion) of the linkage that preserves edge lengths, avoids self-intersections, and results in all arcs becoming straight and all polygons becoming convex.",
