  "rephrased": "Any planar graph can be represented as the intersection graph of a set of line segments in the plane.",
  "implication_form": "If a graph is planar, then it can be represented as the intersection graph of a set of line segments in the plane.",

  "year_originated": 40,
  "explained": "Scheinerman's conjecture, now a theorem, states that every planar graph is an intersection graph of a set of line segments in the plane. This means that for any planar graph, there exists a collection of line segments in the Euclidean plane such that two vertices of the graph are adjacent if and only if the corresponding line segments intersect. The conjecture was formulated by E. R. Scheinerman in 1984 and was proven by Jeremie Chalopin and Daniel Gonçalves in 2009.",
