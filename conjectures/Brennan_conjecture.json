  "name": "Brennan conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brennan_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "A simply connected region in the complex plane can be mapped bijectively onto the unit disk via a conformal map, and the integral of the absolute value of the map's derivative raised to any power p (between 4/3 and 4) remains finite.",
  "implication_form": "If a simply connected open subset W of the complex plane (with at least two boundary points) admits a conformal map onto the unit disk, then the integral of |f'(z)|^p over W is finite for all p in (4/3, 4).",
  "posed_by": "Brennan (attributed to the conjecture)",
  "solved_by": "Unsolved",
  "year_originated": 60,
  "explained": "The Brennan conjecture concerns the integrability of the derivative of conformal maps. It states that for any simply connected open subset W of the complex plane with at least two boundary points, and for any conformal map f mapping W onto the open unit disk \\(\\mathbb{D}\\), the integral \\(\\int_{W} |f'(z)|^p  dA(z)\\) is finite for all \\(p\\) satisfying \\(\\frac{4}{3} < p < 4\\), where dA(z) denotes the area element. While J. G. Brennan proved the conjecture holds for \\(\\frac{4}{3} < p < 3 + \\delta\\) for some \\(\\delta > 0\\), the general case \\(\\frac{4}{.} < p < 4\\) remains unproven.",
