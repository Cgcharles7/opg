  "summary": "The Brennan conjecture is a hypothesis in complex analysis about the integral of the derivative of a conformal map. It states that for a conformal map from a simply connected planar domain to the unit disk, the integral of the absolute value of the derivative raised to a power \\(p\\) is finite, specifically for \\(p\\) between \\(4/3\\) and \\(4\\). While Brennan proved it holds for \\(4/3<p<3+\\delta \\) for some \\(\\delta >0\\), the conjecture remains unproven for the full range of \\(4/3<p<4\\). ",
  "head":  "\\(W\\) is a simply connected open subset of the complex plane with at least two boundary points, and \\(f\\) is a conformal map of \\(W\\) onto the open unit disk \\(\\mathbb{D}\\)",
