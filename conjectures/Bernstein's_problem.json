  "summary": "Bernstein's problem in differential geometry asks whether a function \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) whose graph is a minimal surface in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) must be a linear function. The problem was solved in stages: the answer is \"yes\" for \\(n\\le 7\\), but \"no\" for \\(n\\ge 8\\), with counterexamples showing that non-linear, entire solutions exist in higher dimensions. ",
