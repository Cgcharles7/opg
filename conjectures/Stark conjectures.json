  "summary": "In number theory, the Stark conjectures, introduced  by Stark (1971, 1975, 1976, 1980) and later  expanded by Tate (1984), give conjectural information about the coefficient of the leading term in the Taylor expansion of an Artin L-function associated with a Galois extension K/k of algebraic number fields. The conjectures  generalize the analytic class number formula expressing the leading coefficient of the Taylor series for the Dedekind zeta function of a number field as the product of a regul",
