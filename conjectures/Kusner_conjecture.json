  "name": "Kusner conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_dimension",
  "rephrased": "The maximum number of points that can be placed in d-dimensional Euclidean space such that all pairs of points are at the same distance from each other is d+1.",
  "implication_form": "If a set of points in d-dimensional Euclidean space exists where all pairs are equidistant, then the size of this set is at most d+1.",
  "posed_by": "Henry Kusner",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 30,
  "explained": "The Kusner conjecture concerns the maximum size of equilateral sets in Euclidean space. An equilateral set is a set of points where all pairwise distances are equal. The conjecture states that the equilateral dimension of d-dimensional Euclidean space (\\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\)) is exactly d+1. This means that the largest possible equilateral set in \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) has d+1 points, and such a set exists (e.g., the vertices of a regular simplex). While it is known that d+1 is achievable, the conjecture asserts that no larger equilateral set exists in any dimension d > 1.",
