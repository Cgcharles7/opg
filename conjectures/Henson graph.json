  "summary": "In graph theory, the Henson graph Gi is an undirected infinite graph, the unique countable homogeneous graph that does not contain an i-vertex clique but that does contain all Ki-free finite graphs as induced subgraphs. For instance, G3 is a triangle-free graph that contains all finite triangle-free graphs.\nThese graphs are named after C. Ward Henson, who published a construction for them (for all i ≥ 3) in 1971. The first of these graphs, G3, is also called the homogeneous triangle-free graph o",
