  "explained": "The Pontryagin classes are defined as characteristic classes for real vector bundles. Given a real vector bundle E over a base space X, the Pontryagin classes are defined via the classifying map f: X → BO, where BO is the classifying space for real vector bundles. Specifically, they are obtained by pulling back the universal Pontryagin classes defined on BO. These classes, denoted p_k(E) for k = 1, 2, ..., and lying in the real cohomology groups H^{4k}(X; ℤ) or more precisely the image of H^{4k}(BO; ℤ) in the cohomology with real coefficients (or often considered modulo torsion), provide topological invariants of the bundle. They are defined using the curvature form of a connection on the bundle, similar to how Chern classes are defined for complex bundles. For the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold, the Pontryagin classes are used to define the Pontryagin characteristic classes of the manifold, playing a crucial role in areas like the Hirzebruch Signature Theorem.",
