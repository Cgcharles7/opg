  "name": "Jacobson radical",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_radical",
  "rephrased": "The Jacobson radical is the set of elements in a ring that annihilate all simple modules, and it is the same whether considering left or right modules.",
  "implication_form": "Not applicable (this is a definition)",
  "posed_by": "Nathan Jacobson",
  "solved_by": "The nilpotency of the Jacobson radical for commutative rings was proven by Nathan Smale, while the general nilpotency conjecture was disproven by Irving Herstein and Derek Henry Faddeev Montgomery.",
  "year_originated": 1945,
  "explained": "In mathematics, more specifically ring theory, the Jacobson radical of a ring R is the ideal consisting of those elements in R that annihilate all simple right R-modules. It happens that substituting 'left' in place of 'right' in the definition yields the same ideal, and so the notion is left–right symmetric.",
