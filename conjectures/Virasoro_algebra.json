  "rephrased": "The Virasoro algebra is a specific type of complex Lie algebra that provides a central extension of the Witt algebra, playing a crucial role in two-dimensional conformal field theory and string theory.",
  "implication_form": "If a central extension of the Witt algebra is required for two-dimensional conformal symmetry, then the Virasoro algebra is the unique nontrivial example.",

  "explained": "The Virasoro algebra \\(\\mathfrak{Vir} = \\mathfrak{Vir}(c)\\) is a complex Lie algebra with generators \\(L_n\\) for \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) and a central element \\(c \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) (the central charge). It is the universal central extension of the Witt algebra, which consists of all vector fields on the circle. The Lie bracket is defined by: \\[ [L_m, L_n] = (m - n)L_{m+n} + \\frac{m^3 - m}{12} \\delta_{m+n,0} c \\quad \\text{for all integers } m, n \\] where the second term is the central extension. The Witt algebra corresponds to the kernel of the central extension map. The Virasoro algebra plays a fundamental role in two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) and bosonic string theory.",
