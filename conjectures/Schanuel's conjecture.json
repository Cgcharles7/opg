  "summary": "In mathematics, specifically transcendental number theory, Schanuel's conjecture is a conjecture about the transcendence degree of certain field extensions of the rational numbers \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Q\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} }\n  \n, which would establish the transcendence of a large class of numbers, for which this is currently unknown. It is due to Stephen Schanuel and was published by Serge Lang in 1966.",
