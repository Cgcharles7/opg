  "summary": "In graph theory, the unproven Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture, made in 1995 by mathematician Paul Erdős and his collaborator András Gyárfás, states that every graph with minimum degree 3 contains a simple cycle whose length is a power of two. Erdős offered a prize of $100 for proving the conjecture, or $50 for a counterexample; it is one of many conjectures of Erdős.\nIf the conjecture is false, a counterexample would take the form of a graph with minimum degree three having no power-of-two cycles.
