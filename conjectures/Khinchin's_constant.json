  "rephrased": "For almost all real numbers, the coefficients in their continued fraction expansion have a geometric mean that equals a specific constant called Khinchin's constant (K0).",
  "implication_form": "If a real number has a continued fraction expansion, then for almost all such numbers, the geometric mean of its coefficients equals Khinchin's constant K0.",

  "explained": "Khinchin's theorem (sometimes referred to in the context of Khinchin's constant) states that for almost all real numbers x (with respect to the Lebesgue measure), the coefficients a₁, a₂, a₃, ... in the simple continued fraction expansion of x satisfy the following property: the limit of the geometric mean of the first n coefficients, (a₁ * a₂ * ... * a_n)^(1/n), as n approaches infinity, exists and equals a specific mathematical constant known as Khinchin's constant, denoted by K₀. This constant is approximately 2.685452016...",
