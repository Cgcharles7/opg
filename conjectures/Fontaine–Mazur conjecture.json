  "summary": "In mathematics, the Fontaine–Mazur conjectures are some conjectures introduced by Fontaine and  Mazur (1995) about when p-adic representations of Galois groups of number fields can be constructed from representations on étale cohomology groups of varieties. Some cases of this conjecture in dimension 2 have been proved by Dieulefait (2004).\nThe first conjecture stated by Fontaine and Mazur assumes that \n  \n    \n      \n        ρ\n        :\n        \n          G\n          a\n          l\n        \n     ",
