  "summary": "In number theory, a noncototient is a positive integer n that cannot be expressed as the difference between a positive integer m and the number of coprime integers below it. That is, m − φ(m) = n, where φ stands for Euler's totient function, has no solution for m.  The cototient of n is defined as n − φ(n), so a noncototient is a number that is never a cototient.\nIt is conjectured that all noncototients are even. This follows from a modified form of the slightly stronger version of the Goldbach ",
