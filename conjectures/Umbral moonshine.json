  "summary": "In mathematics, umbral moonshine is a mysterious connection between Niemeier lattices and  Ramanujan's mock theta functions.  It is a generalization of the Mathieu moonshine phenomenon connecting representations of the Mathieu group M24 with K3 surfaces.\nThe usage of the term \"umbral\" in this context is unrelated to the umbral calculus.",
