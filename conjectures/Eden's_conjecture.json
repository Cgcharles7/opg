  "explained": "Eden's conjecture, proposed by Alp Eden in 1987, addresses the Eden growth model, a stochastic process modeling the expansion of bacterial colonies or tumors. The core conjecture states that, regardless of the specific random sequence driving the growth process, the shape of the aggregate (the set of occupied sites) approaches a Euclidean ball (a sphere in n-dimensional space) as the process continues indefinitely, provided the growth occurs in two or three dimensions. This limit shape is assumed to be isotropic (uniform in all directions). While the conjecture appears plausible and holds empirically in low-dimensional settings (like two dimensions), it has been rigorously disproven for dimensions greater than 22.",
