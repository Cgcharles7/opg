  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden%27s_conjecture",
  "summary": "In the mathematics of dynamical systems, Eden's conjecture states that the supremum of the local Lyapunov dimensions on the global attractor is achieved on a stationary point or an unstable periodic orbit embedded into the attractor. \nThe validity of the conjecture was proved for a number of well-known systems having global attractor (e.g. for the global attractors in the Lorenz system, complex Ginzburgâ€“Landau equation). It is named after Alp Eden, who proposed it in 1987.",
