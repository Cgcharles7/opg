  "summary": "Eden's conjecture is a statement from a geometric growth model that the overall shape formed by the growth process is a Euclidean ball, say arXiv. It was proposed by Alp Eden in 1987 and concerns the limit shape of the Eden growth model, which is a random process for simulating growth, such as bacterial colonies or tumors. However, the conjecture has been disproven in higher dimensions (dimensions greater than 22), though it appears to hold in lower dimensions. ",
  "head": "A dynamical system has a global attractor.",
  "tail": "The supremum of the local Lyapunov dimensions on that global attractor is achieved on either a stationary point or an unstable periodic orbit within the attractor. ",
