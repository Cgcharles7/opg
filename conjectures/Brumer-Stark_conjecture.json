  "name": "Brumer–Stark conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brumer%E2%80%93Stark_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The conjecture links the special values of certain L-functions to the structure of the ideal class group in an abelian extension, specifically stating that a specific element (the Stickelberger element) annihilates the class group.",
  "implication_form": "If H/F is a finite abelian extension of number fields with F totally real, H a CM field, and S, T are disjoint finite sets of places satisfying standard conditions, then the Stickelberger element Θ_{H/F,S,T} annihilates the relevant class group.",

  "year_originated": 40,
  "explained": "The Brumer–Stark conjecture pertains to finite abelian extensions H/F of number fields where F is totally real and H is a CM field. It involves two disjoint finite sets of places S and T of F, containing all infinite places and all finite places that are ramified in H/F. The conjecture asserts that the Stickel (or Stark) element Θ_{H/F,S,T}, which resides in the rational group ring Q[Gal(H/F)], annihilates the class group Cl_F(S) of F with respect to the set S.",
