  "summary": "The Brumer–Stark conjecture is a conjecture in algebraic number theory that connects the special values of L-functions to the structure of ideal class groups. It states that a certain element called the Stickelberger element annihilates the relevant class group of an abelian extension of number fields. The conjecture is a key part of Stark's conjectures and has a deep connection to Hilbert's twelfth problem, which is the goal of constructing class fields explicitly. ",
  "head": "\\(H/F\\) is a finite abelian extension of number fields (with \\(F\\) totally real and \\(H\\) a CM field), \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) are disjoint finite sets of places of \\(F\\) (containing all infinite places and ramified finite places) satisfying certain standard conditions, and \\(\\Theta _{H/F,S,T}\\) is the associated Stickelberger element in the rational group ring \\(\\mathbb{Q}[Gal(H/F)]\\), ",
