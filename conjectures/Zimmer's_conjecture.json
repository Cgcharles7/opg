  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmer%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Higher-rank lattices (a type of symmetry) cannot act on geometric spaces of lower dimension than their rank.",
  "implication_form": "If a geometric space admits a higher-rank lattice symmetry, then the space must be of dimension at least the rank of the lattice.",
  "posed_by": "Robert Zimmer",

  "year_originated": 35,
  "explained": "Zimmer's conjecture states that there is a function, depending on the rank of the lattice and the dimension of the space, such that any action of a higher-rank lattice (e.g., SL(n, Z) for n ≥ 3) on a compact manifold that preserves a rigid geometric structure (such as a Riemannian metric, symplectic form, or complex structure) must be essentially algebraic (or induced by a linear representation) if the dimension of the manifold is sufficiently large. In other words, higher-rank lattices cannot act faithfully and effectively on compact manifolds of dimension less than some bound depending on the lattice's rank, unless the action is highly structured (e.g., preserves a foliation or is induced by a representation).",
