  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholz_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The shortest addition chain for a number n has a length no more than roughly twice the logarithm base 2 of n.",
  "implication_form": "If n is a positive integer, then the minimal length of an addition chain for n is at most log₂(2n-1) + 1.",
  "posed_by": [
    "Arnold Scholz",

  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 86,
  "explained": "The Scholz conjecture is an unsolved problem in mathematics that states for any positive integer \\(n\\), the length of the shortest addition chain for \\(2^{n}-1\\) is less than or equal to the length of the shortest addition chain for \\(n\\) plus \\(n-1\\). In simpler terms, it proposes an upper bound on how difficult it is to construct a sequence of numbers to produce \\(2^{n}-1\\), suggesting it's only slightly more complex than producing \\(n\\). ",
