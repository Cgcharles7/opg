  "rephrased": "The Weyl algebra is a specific type of non-commutative algebra that can be abstracted from the ring of differential operators with polynomial coefficients, often used in mathematical contexts like quantum mechanics.",
  "implication_form": "This structure describes the algebra of differential operators.",
  "posed_by": "Hermann Weyl",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 100,
  "explained": "The Weyl algebra over a field F (typically of characteristic zero) is the algebra generated by two elements, say X and D (representing multiplication by x and differentiation with respect to x), satisfying the commutation relation [X, D] = XD - DX = 1. More formally, it is the algebra with generators X, D and defining relation XD - DX = 1. This algebra can also be defined as the algebra of polynomial differential operators on the polynomial ring F[x], where elements are polynomials in X and D with coefficients in F[x]. The Weyl algebra W_1(F) (for one variable) is a fundamental example of a simple central algebra. In general, the n-variable Weyl algebra W_n(F) is the algebra generated by X_1, ..., X_n, D_1, ..., D_n with relations [X_i, X_j] = 0, [D_i, D_j] = 0, [X_i, D_j] = δ_{ij} (Kronecker delta), and XD - DX = 1 for i=j, and [X_i, D_j] = 0 for i≠j.",
