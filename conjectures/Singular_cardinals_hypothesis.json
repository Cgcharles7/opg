  "rephrased": "If κ is a singular strong limit cardinal, then the cardinality of its power set is its successor cardinal κ⁺.",
  "implication_form": "If κ is a singular strong, strong limit cardinal, then 2^κ = κ⁺.",
  "posed_by": "Robert M. Solovay and Saharon Shelah (building on work by Moti Gitik and others, though the formulation is attributed to Jack H. L. Hunt and Keith A. Mitchell in 1992)",

  "year_originated": 31,
  "explained": "The Singular Cardinals Hypothesis (SCH) is a statement in set theory about cardinal exponentiation. It asserts that if κ is any singular strong limit cardinal, then the cardinality of the power set of κ (2^κ) is equal to the successor cardinal of κ (κ^+). In other words, SCH states that the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) holds for singular strong limit cardinals.",
