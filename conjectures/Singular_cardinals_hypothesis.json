  "summary": "In set theory, the singular cardinals hypothesis (SCH) arose from the question of whether the least cardinal number for which the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) might fail could be a singular cardinal.\nAccording to Mitchell (1992), the singular cardinals hypothesis is:\n\nIf κ is any singular strong limit cardinal, then 2κ = κ+.\nHere, κ+ denotes the successor cardinal of κ.\nSince SCH is a consequence of GCH, which is known to be consistent with ZFC, SCH is consistent with ZFC.
