  "summary": "In set theory, a strongly compact cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal.\nAn uncountable cardinal κ is strongly compact if and only if every κ-complete filter can be extended to a κ-complete ultrafilter.\nStrongly compact cardinals were originally defined in terms of infinitary logic, where logical operators are allowed to take infinitely many operands. The logic on a regular cardinal κ is defined by requiring the number of operands for each operator to be less than κ; then κ is strongly co",
