  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture",
  "summary": "The Collatz conjecture is a mathematical speculation that states any positive integer will eventually reach 1 if you repeatedly apply a simple set of rules: if the number is even, divide it by 2; if it's odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Despite being easy to state, it remains unproven and has famously resisted resolution for decades, though it has been verified by computer for a vast range of numbers. ",
  "head": "A positive integer \\(n\\) is chosen as the starting point for the Collatz sequence and the rules are applied repeatedly.", 
  "tail": "The sequence generated by this process will eventually reach the number 1. ",
