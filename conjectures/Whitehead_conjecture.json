  "summary": "The Whitehead conjecture (also known as the Whitehead asphericity conjecture) is a claim in algebraic topology. It was formulated by J. H. C. Whitehead in 1941. It states that every connected subcomplex of a two-dimensional aspherical CW complex is aspherical.\nA group presentation \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n        =\n        (\n        S\n        âˆ£\n        R\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G=(S\\mid R)}\n  \n is called aspherical if the two-dimensional CW complex \n  \n    \n      \n        K\n   ",
