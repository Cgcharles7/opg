  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehead_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "If a two-dimensional CW complex has a trivial fundamental group (aspherical), then any connected subcomplex is also aspherical (has a trivial fundamental group).",
  "implication_form": "If a CW complex is aspherical and two-dimensional, then every connected subcomplex is aspherical.",
  "posed_by": "J. H. C. Whitehead",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 83,
  "explained": "The Whitehead conjecture, proposed by J. H. C. Whitehead in 1941, is a statement in algebraic topology. It claims that if a CW complex is two-dimensional and aspherical (meaning its universal cover is contractible), then every connected subcomplex of this complex is also aspherical.",
