  "explained": "A Lychrel number is a natural number that does not form a palindrome through an iterative process involving repeatedly reversing its digits and adding the original number and the reversed number. This process is known as the reverse-and-add operation. The term 'Lychrel' was coined by Wade Van Landingham, referencing the anagram 'Cheryl'. While the reverse-and-add process is well-defined, it remains unproven whether any natural numbers exist that never produce a palindrome through this process in base 10, although many such numbers, including 196, are strongly suspected to be Lychrel numbers based on heuristic and statistical evidence.",
