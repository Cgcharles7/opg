  "summary": "Circle packing in an equilateral triangle is a packing problem in discrete mathematics where the objective is to pack n unit circles into the smallest possible equilateral triangle.  Optimal solutions have been proved for n ≤ 15, and for any triangular number of circles, and conjectures are available for n ≤ 34.\nA conjecture of Paul Erdős and Norman Oler states that, if n is a triangular number, then the optimal packings of n − 1 and of n circles have the same side length: that is, according to ",
