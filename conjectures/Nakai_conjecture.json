  "rephrased": "A complex algebraic variety is smooth if its ring of differential operators is generated by its derivations.",

  "explained": "The Nakai conjecture, proposed by Yoshikazu Nakai in 1961, addresses the relationship between the ring of differential operators on an algebraic variety and its smoothness. The core statement of the conjecture is: If V is a complex algebraic variety such that its ring of differential operators is generated by the derivations it contains (i.e., all differential operators are built from derivations), then V is necessarily a smooth variety. Conversely, Alexander Grothendieck proved that for smooth algebraic varieties, the ring of differential operators is indeed generated by its derivations. However, Nakai's specific conjecture pertains only to the first implication: the condition on the ring implying smoothness.",
