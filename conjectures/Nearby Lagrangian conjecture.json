  "summary": "In mathematics, more specifically symplectic topology, the nearby Lagrangian conjecture, is an open mathematical problem often attributed to Vladimir Arnold. It states that every closed exact Lagrangian submanifold of a cotangent bundle Tâˆ—M (with symplectic structure) is Hamiltonian isotopic to the zero section.\nIt is closely related to the theory of generating functions.\n\n\n== References ==",
