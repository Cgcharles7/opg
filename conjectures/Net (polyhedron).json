Polyhedral nets are a useful aid to the study of polyhedra and solid geometry in general, as they allow for physical models of polyhedra to be constructed from material such as thin cardboard.\nAn early instance of polyhedral nets appears in the works of Albrecht DÃ¼rer, whose 1525 book A Course in the Art of Measurement w",
