  "explained": "The Willmore conjecture states that for any torus immersed in Euclidean 3-space, the Willmore energy is minimized for the Clifford torus (i.e., the torus obtained as the orbit under the rotation group SO(3) of a circle in the xy-plane with radius 1/√2), and this minimum value is 2π. The Willmore energy, denoted by 𝒪, is defined for any closed surface Σ embedded in R³ as an integral quantity: 𝒪(Σ) = ∫_Σ (|A|² - 2|H|⁴) dA, where A is the second fundamental form, H is the mean curvature vector, and dA is the area element. It can also be expressed as 𝒪(Σ) = ∫_Σ |∇N|² dA, where N is the unit normal vector, or equivalently as the Möbius invariant functional ∫_Σ |∇N|² dA. The conjecture is about finding the global minimum of this energy among all tori in R³.",
