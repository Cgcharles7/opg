  "summary": "In fluid dynamics, the Euler equations are a set of partial differential equations governing adiabatic and inviscid flow. They are named after Leonhard Euler. In particular, they correspond to the Navierâ€“Stokes equations with zero viscosity and zero thermal conductivity.\nThe Euler equations can be applied to incompressible and compressible flows. The incompressible Euler equations consist of Cauchy equations for conservation of mass and balance of momentum, together with the incompressibility co",
