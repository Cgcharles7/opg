  "summary": "In algebraic number theory, Leopoldt's conjecture, introduced by  H.-W. Leopoldt (1962, 1975), states that the p-adic regulator of a number field does not vanish. The p-adic regulator is an analogue of the usual \nregulator defined using p-adic logarithms instead of the usual logarithms, introduced by H.-W. Leopoldt (1962).",
