  "summary": "In mathematics, the mean value problem was posed by Stephen Smale in 1981. This problem is still open in full generality. The problem asks:\n\nFor a given complex polynomial \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n of degree \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        â‰¥\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d\\geq 2}\n  \n and a complex number \n  \n    \n      \n        z\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle z}\n  \n, is there a critical point \n  \n    \n      \n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displays",
