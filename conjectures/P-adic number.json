  "summary": "In number theory, given a prime number p, the p-adic numbers form an extension of the rational numbers that is distinct from the real numbers, though with some similar properties; p-adic numbers can be written in a form similar to (possibly infinite) decimals, but with digits based on a prime number p rather than ten, and extending to the left rather than to the right.\nFor example, comparing the expansion of the rational number \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1\n   ",
