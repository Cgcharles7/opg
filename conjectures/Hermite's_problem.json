  "rephrased": "Find a method to represent every real number as a sequence of natural numbers such that the sequence eventually becomes periodic if and only if the original number is a cubic irrational (a root of a cubic polynomial with integer coefficients).",
  "implication_form": "If a real number is a cubic irrational, then its sequence representation is eventually periodic.",

  "explained": "Hermite's interpolation problem is a polynomial interpolation method where the goal is to find a polynomial that matches a function's values and its derivatives at given points (nodes). Unlike Lagrange interpolation, which only uses function values, Hermite interpolation uses both function values and derivative values to create a smoother and more accurate polynomial approximation. For a given set of data points, the resulting polynomial will have a degree that is less than the total number of conditions (function values + derivative values). ",
