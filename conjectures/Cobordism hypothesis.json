  "summary": "In mathematics, the cobordism hypothesis, due to John C. Baez and James Dolan, concerns the classification of extended topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). In 2008, Jacob Lurie outlined a proof of the cobordism hypothesis, though the details of his approach have yet to appear in the literature as of 2022. In 2021, Daniel Grady and Dmitri Pavlov claimed a complete proof of the cobordism hypothesis, as well as a generalization to bordisms with arbitrary geometric structures.",
