  "summary": "In the mathematics of graph drawing, Tur치n's brick factory problem asks for the minimum number of crossings in a drawing of a complete bipartite graph. The problem is named after P치l Tur치n, who formulated it while being forced to work in a brick factory during World War II.\nA drawing method found by Kazimierz Zarankiewicz has been conjectured to give the correct answer for every complete bipartite graph, and the statement that this is true has come to be known as the Zarankiewicz crossing number",
