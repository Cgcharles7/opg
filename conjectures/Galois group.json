  "summary": "In mathematics, in the area of abstract algebra known as Galois theory, the Galois group of a certain type of field extension is a specific group associated with the field extension. The study of field extensions and their relationship to the polynomials that give rise to them via Galois groups is called Galois theory, so named in honor of Ã‰variste Galois who first discovered them.\nFor a more elementary discussion of Galois groups in terms of permutation groups, see the article on Galois theory.",
