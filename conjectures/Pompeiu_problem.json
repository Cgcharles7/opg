  "rephrased": "If a continuous function's integral over every rotated and translated copy of a simply connected Lipschitz domain K is zero, then K must be a ball.",
  "implication_form": "If the integral of a nonzero continuous function vanishes on every congruent copy of a simply connected Lipschitz domain K, then K is a ball.",

  "year_originated": 94,
  "explained": "The Pompeiu problem is a conjecture in integral geometry. It states that if a nonzero continuous function f defined on a Euclidean space has the property that its integral vanishes (i.e., is zero) over every congruent copy (i.e., every translation, rotation, and scaling) of a given simply connected Lipschitz domain K, then the domain K itself must be a ball (in the Euclidean space).",
