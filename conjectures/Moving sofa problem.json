  "summary": "In mathematics, the moving sofa problem or sofa problem is a two-dimensional idealization of real-life furniture-moving problems and asks for the rigid two-dimensional shape of the largest area that can be maneuvered through an L-shaped planar region with legs of unit width. The area thus obtained is referred to as the sofa constant. The exact value of the sofa constant is an open problem. The leading solution, by Joseph L. Gerver, has a value of approximately 2.2195.
