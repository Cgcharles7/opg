  "summary": "In the mathematical field of graph theory, a complete graph is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.  A complete digraph is a directed graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a pair of unique edges (one in each direction).\nGraph theory itself is typically dated as beginning with Leonhard Euler's 1736 work on the Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg. However, drawings of complete graphs, with their vertices placed on the po",
