  "rephrased": "The longest path between any two vertices of a d-dimensional polytope with n facets is at most n minus d.",
  "implication_form": "If a polytope has n facets in d-dimensional space, then the diameter of its edge-vertex graph is at most n minus d.",

  "explained": "The Hirsch conjecture, proposed by Warren M. Hirsch in 1957, concerns the diameter of the edge-vertex graph of a polytope. Specifically, it states that for a d-dimensional polytope with n facets (n-dimensional faces), the diameter of its edge-vertex graph (the graph where vertices are the polytope's vertices and edges are its edges) is at most n - d. This means that any two vertices of the polytope can be connected by a path along the edges of the polytope that has length (number of edges) no greater than n - d.",
