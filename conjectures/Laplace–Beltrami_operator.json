  "summary": "In differential geometry, the Laplace–Beltrami operator is a generalization of the Laplace operator to functions defined on submanifolds in Euclidean space and, even more generally, on Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. It is named after Pierre-Simon Laplace and Eugenio Beltrami.\nFor any twice-differentiable real-valued function f defined on Euclidean space Rn, the Laplace operator (also known as the Laplacian) takes f to the divergence of its gradient vector field, which is the sum of ",
