  "summary": "In topology, two continuous functions from one topological space to another are called homotopic (from Ancient Greek: ὁμός homós 'same, similar' and τόπος tópos 'place') if one can be \"continuously deformed\" into the other, such a deformation being called a homotopy ( hə-MOT-ə-pee;  HOH-moh-toh-pee) between the two functions. A notable use of homotopy is the definition of homotopy groups and cohomotopy groups, important invariants in algebraic topology.\nIn practice, there are technical difficult",
