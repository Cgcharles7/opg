  "rephrased": "Grundy's game is a two-player strategy game starting with one heap of objects, where players alternately split a heap into two unequal heaps. The game ends with heaps of size 1 or 2, which cannot be split further. The player who makes the last move wins.",

  "explained": "Grundy's game is a two-player impartial game played with a single heap of objects. Players take turns splitting a heap into two non-empty heaps of different sizes. The game continues until only heaps of size 1 or 2 remain, which cannot be split unequally further. This game is typically analyzed under the normal play convention, where the player making the last move (i.e., the last split) wins.",
