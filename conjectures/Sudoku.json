  "rephrased": "Fill a 9x9 grid with digits 1-9 such that each row, column, and 3x3 box contains all digits 1-9 exactly once, given some starting numbers.",
  "implication_form": "If a partially filled 9x9 grid satisfies the Sudoku rules and has exactly one solution, then it is a valid Sudoku puzzle.",

  "explained": "Sudoku is a combinatorial puzzle defined on a 9×9 grid, divided into nine 3×3 subgrids (boxes). The objective is to fill the grid with digits 1 through 9 such that each row, each column, and each box contains each digit exactly once. A Sudoku puzzle is presented with a partially filled grid, and the challenge is to complete it according to these rules. The term 'conjecture' may be misleading here, as Sudoku is primarily a puzzle format, but the question of whether certain configurations (like minimal clues) lead to unique solutions is an area of combinatorial study.",
