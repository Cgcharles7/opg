  "summary": "The Dehn invariant is a mathematical value assigned to a polyhedron that determines if it can be cut and reassembled into another polyhedron. Two polyhedra are \"scissors-congruent\" (can be dissected into each other) if and only if they have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant. Named after Max Dehn, it was used to prove that not all polyhedra with the same volume can be dissected into one another, thus solving Hilbert's third problem. ",
