  "rephrased": "A polyhedron has a Dehn invariant, a value calculated from its edge lengths and dihedral angles. Two polyhedra can be cut apart and reassembled into each other (scissors-congruent) only if they have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant.",
  "implication_form": "If two polyhedra have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant, then they can be dissected into each other.",
  "posed_by": "Max Dehn",
  "solved_by": "Max Dehn",
  "year_originated": 123,
  "explained": "The Dehn invariant is a value defined for a polyhedron, combining information about its edge lengths and the angles between its faces (dihedral angles). Formally, for a polyhedron, it is defined as the set { l * cot(θ) } where the set includes one term for each edge, 'l' being the length of the edge and 'θ' being the internal dihedral angle of the polyhedron at that edge. Two convex polyhedra are scissors-congruent (can be dissected into each other by cutting along faces and reassembling the pieces) if and only if they have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant. Although named a 'conjecture' in the prompt, Dehn's theorem proves this statement, showing it is a characterization (a theorem), not an open conjecture.",
