  "explained": "Leopoldt's conjecture, formulated by H.-W. Leopoldt in 1962 and further developed in 1975, pertains to number fields in algebraic number theory. It states that for any algebraic number field K, any prime number p, and any sufficiently large integer n, the p-adic regulator (an analogue of the classical regulator defined using p-adic logarithms introduced by Leopoldt himself) does not vanish. This means that the p-adic regulator is a non-zero element in the ring of p-adic integers, indicating that the units in the ring of integers of K have a specific p-adic logarithmic independence property. The conjecture is crucial as it implies that the p-adic logarithm map from the group of units modulo roots of unity to the p-adic logarithm of the ideal class group has full rank.",
