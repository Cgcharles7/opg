  "rephrased": "Every connected graph has a pebbling number equal to twice the number of vertices minus one.",
  "implication_form": "If a graph is connected, then its pebbling number is 2n-1.",

  "explained": "Graham's pebbling conjecture, proposed by Ronald Graham, pertains to the maximum pebbling number for certain graphs. It states that for any connected graph G with n vertices, there exists a root graph (a graph with a specific structure, often a power of a path graph) such that when G is used as a base graph to form the Cartesian product with the root graph (resulting in a graph with n vertices), the pebbling number of this product graph is at most 3^n. The pebbling number π(G) is the smallest number such that any distribution of π(G) pebbles on the vertices of G allows a pebbler to move pebbles (via pebbling moves) to any target vertex.",
