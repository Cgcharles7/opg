  "rephrased": "A Woodin cardinal is a type of large cardinal that is defined by the property that for every function from the cardinal to itself, there exists a smaller cardinal such that the critical point of a certain embedding equals that smaller cardinal.",
  "implication_form": "It is not straightforward to rephrase this definition in the form 'If P, then Q' as it describes a property defining the cardinal rather than a conditional statement.",
  "posed_by": "W. Hugh Woodin",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 32,
  "explained": "A Woodin cardinal is a cardinal number λ such that for every function f: λ → λ, there exists a cardinal κ < λ with the property that for all β > κ, V_{f(β)} = V_{κ + ω(β)}. This condition ensures that the cumulative hierarchy reflects the structure of the cardinal in a specific way for functions defined on it.",
