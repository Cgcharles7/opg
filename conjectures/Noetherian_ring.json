  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noetherian_ring",
  "rephrased": "A Noetherian ring is one where any collection of ideals can be built from a finite number by taking intersections and summing up, or equivalently, where any ascending sequence of ideals eventually stabilizes.",
  "implication_form": "If a ring satisfies the ascending chain condition on its ideals (or left/right ideals), then it is a Noetherian ring.",
  "posed_by": "Emmy Noether",
  "solved_by": "The concept is foundational in ring theory and is considered solved; it's a cornerstone definition.",
