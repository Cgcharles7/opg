  "name": "Schanuel's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schanuel%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "If you take n complex numbers and their natural logarithms, arrange them in a special way (like putting the logs of some numbers and the numbers themselves together), then this set of 2n numbers is so 'independent' over the rational numbers that at most n of them can be expressed using basic arithmetic operations starting from the rational numbers.",
  "implication_form": "If there exists a set of n complex numbers and their natural logarithms arranged in a specific way, then the resulting set of 2n numbers has a high transcendence degree over the rationals (specifically, its transcendence degree is at least n).",
