  "name": "Schanuel's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schanuel%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "If you take n complex numbers and their natural logarithms, arrange them in a special way (like putting the logs of some numbers and the numbers themselves together), then this set of 2n numbers is so 'independent' over the rational numbers that at most n of them can be expressed using basic arithmetic operations starting from the rational numbers.",
  "implication_form": "If there exists a set of n complex numbers and their natural logarithms arranged in a specific way, then the resulting set of 2n numbers has a high transcendence degree over the rationals (specifically, its transcendence degree is at least n).",
  "posed_by": "Stephen Schanuel",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 60,
  "explained": "For any set of complex numbers \\(z_{1},\\dots ,z_{n}\\) that are linearly independent over the rational numbers (\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)), the field \\(\\mathbb{Q}(z_{1},\\dots ,z_{n},e^{z_{1}},\\dots ,e^{z_{n}})\\) has a transcendence degree of at least \\(n\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). ",
