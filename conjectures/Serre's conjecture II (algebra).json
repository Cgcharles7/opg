  "summary": "In mathematics, Jean-Pierre Serre conjectured the following statement regarding the Galois cohomology of a simply connected semisimple algebraic group.  Namely, he conjectured that if G is such a group over a perfect field F of cohomological dimension at most 2, then the Galois cohomology set H1(F, G) is zero.\nA converse of the conjecture holds: if the field F is perfect and if the cohomology set H1(F, G) is zero for every semisimple simply connected algebraic group G then the p-cohomological di",
