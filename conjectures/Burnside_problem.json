  "explained": "The Burnside problem is a foundational question in group theory that asks: If a group is finitely generated and every element in the group has finite order (i.e., for each element g, there exists some positive integer n such that g^n = e, the identity element), then must the group itself be finite? This problem was originally posed by William Burnside in 1902. The general case (where no specific bound is imposed on the orders of elements) was answered negatively in 1964 by a counterexample constructed by Efim Golod and Igor Shafarevich. However, the problem remains highly active and complex, with the restricted Burnside problem (where the orders of all elements divide a fixed positive integer n) still being a major open question in the field.",
