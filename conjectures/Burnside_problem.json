  "summary": "The Burnside problem is a question in group theory: must a finitely generated group where every element has finite order be a finite group? Posed by William Burnside in 1902, this question was answered negatively for the general case by a 1964 counter-example from Golod and Shafarevich. Variations of the problem have also been studied extensively, such as the restricted Burnside problem which specifies that all elements have an order that is a divisor of a fixed integer \\(n\\). ",
