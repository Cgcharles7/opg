  "name": "Sendov's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendov%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "If a polynomial with complex coefficients has a root very close to the boundary of the unit disk, then there must be a critical point (point where the derivative is zero) very close to that root.",
  "implication_form": "If a polynomial f(z) = (z - r1)(z - r2)...(z - rn) (with complex coefficients) has a root at r_i that satisfies |r_i| ≥ 1 - ε (i.e., very close to the unit circle |z| = 1), then there exists a critical point of f(z) within ε of r_i.",
  "posed_by": "Blagovest Sendov",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 56,
  "explained": "Sendov's conjecture states that if all zeros of a polynomial lie in the closed unit disk, then for each zero, there must be a critical point (a zero of the polynomial's derivative) within a distance of 1. This means that every zero of a polynomial is close to a critical point. The conjecture is an open problem, but parts of it have been proven for specific cases and for high-degree polynomials.",
