  "summary": "The Erdős–Moser equation is the Diophantine equation \\(\\sum _{i=1}^{m-1}i^{k}=m^{k}\\), which states that the sum of the \\(k^{th}\\) powers of the first \\(m-1\\) positive integers equals \\(m^{k}\\). The Erdős–Moser conjecture is that this equation has no solution for positive integers \\(k\\ge 2\\). The only known integer solution is \\((k,m)=(1,3)\\), which satisfies \\(1^{1}+2^{1}=3^{1}\\). ",
