  "summary": "In number theory, Cramér's conjecture, formulated by the Swedish mathematician Harald Cramér in 1936, is an estimate for the size of gaps between consecutive prime numbers: intuitively, that gaps between consecutive primes are always small, and the conjecture quantifies asymptotically just how small they must be.  It states that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            n\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          p\n          \n            n\n   ",
