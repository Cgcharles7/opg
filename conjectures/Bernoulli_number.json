  "summary": "A Bernoulli number is a term in a sequence of rational numbers that appears frequently in mathematics, especially in calculus and number theory. These numbers are used in formulas for sums of integer powers, such as calculating \\(1^{m}+2^{m}+\\dots +n^{m}\\), and they also arise in series expansions for functions like the tangent. A notable pattern is that all Bernoulli numbers with an odd index are zero, except for the first one (\\(B_{1}\\)), while the even-indexed numbers (\\(B_{2},B_{4},B_{6},\\dots \\)) alternate in sign. ",
