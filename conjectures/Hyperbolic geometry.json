  "summary": "In mathematics, hyperbolic geometry (also called Lobachevskian geometry or Bolyaiâ€“Lobachevskian geometry) is a non-Euclidean geometry. The parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry is replaced with:\n\nFor any given line R and point P not on R, in the plane containing both line R and point P there are at least two distinct lines through P that do not intersect R.\n(Compare the above with Playfair's axiom, the modern version of Euclid's parallel postulate.)\nThe hyperbolic plane is a plane where every",
