  "summary": "In geometry, a disk (also spelled disc) is the region in a plane bounded by a circle. A disk is said to be closed if it contains the circle that constitutes its boundary, and open if it does not.\nFor a radius \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  \n, an open disk is usually denoted as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          D\n          \n            r\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D_{r}}\n  \n, and a closed disk is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n         ",
