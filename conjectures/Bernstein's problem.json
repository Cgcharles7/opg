  "summary": "In differential geometry, Bernstein's problem is as follows: if the graph of a function on Rnâˆ’1 is a minimal surface in Rn, does this imply that the function is linear? \nThis is true for n at most 8, but false for n at least 9.  The problem is named for Sergei Natanovich Bernstein who solved the case n = 3 in 1914.",
