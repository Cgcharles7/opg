  "explained": "The Herzog–Schönheim conjecture, proposed in 1974, addresses a covering condition involving a finite group G, a subset A of G, and the stabilizer subgroup H of A (the set of elements fixing A pointwise). It states that if the left cosets of H cover the entire group G, then the number of such cosets, denoted k, satisfies k * |A| ≥ |G|, where |A| and |G| denote the cardinalities of A and G respectively. Furthermore, the conjecture suggests that equality holds if and only if the covering is a disjoint union of the cosets (i.e., a partition).",
