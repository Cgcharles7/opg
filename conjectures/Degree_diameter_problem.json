  "summary": "The degree-diameter problem is a graph theory problem that seeks the maximum number of vertices (\\(n\\)) for a graph with a given maximum degree (\\(\\Delta \\)) and diameter (\\(k\\)). The problem is a key issue in network design, as the degree relates to the number of connections a node has, and the diameter indicates the maximum path length between any two nodes. ",
  "head": "a graph \\(G\\) has a maximum degree \\(d\\) and a diameter \\(k\\)",
  "tail": "number of vertices in \\(G\\) is at most the Moore bound \\(M(d,k)\\)",
