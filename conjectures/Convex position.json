  "summary": "In discrete and computational geometry, a set of points in the Euclidean plane or a higher-dimensional Euclidean space is said to be in convex position or convex independent if none of the points can be represented as a convex combination of the others. A finite set of points is in convex position if all of the points are vertices of their convex hull. More generally, a family of convex sets is said to be in convex position if they are pairwise disjoint and none of them is contained in the conve",
