  "summary": "Mathematically, chess can be defined as a finite, two-player, zero-sum game of perfect information in the field of combinatorial game theory. It is characterized by an 8x8 grid, specific rules for piece movement, and a defined set of possible moves and game states that can be represented in a massive game tree. The complexity is so high that the number of possible positions is estimated to be far greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe. ",
