  "summary": "In geometric topology, the Borel conjecture (named for Armand Borel) asserts that an aspherical closed manifold is determined by its fundamental group, up to homeomorphism.  It is a rigidity conjecture, asserting that a weak, algebraic notion of equivalence (namely, homotopy equivalence) should imply a stronger, topological notion (namely, homeomorphism).",
