  "rephrased": "A complex algebraic variety is smooth if its ring of differential operators is generated by its derivations.",

  "explained": "The Zariski-Lipman conjecture is a statement in algebraic geometry. It claims that if a complex algebraic variety has a ring of differential operators that is finitely generated over the structure sheaf by its derivations, then the variety must be smooth. In other words, smoothness is characterized by the finite generation property of its differential operators with respect to derivations.",
