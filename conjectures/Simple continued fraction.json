  "summary": "A simple or regular continued fraction is a continued fraction with numerators all equal to one, and denominators built from a sequence \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        \n          a\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{a_{i}\\}}\n  \n of integer numbers. The sequence can be finite or infinite, resulting in a finite (or terminated) continued fraction like\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        +\n  ",
