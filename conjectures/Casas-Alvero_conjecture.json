  "rephrased": "If a polynomial and all its derivatives up to the (d-1)-th derivative share a common root, then the polynomial must have only one distinct root (i.e., it is a power of a linear polynomial).",
  "implication_form": "If a univariate polynomial of degree d has a common root with each of its first d-1 derivatives, then it has only one distinct root.",
