  "rephrased": "A Wall–Sun–Sun prime is a prime number p for which F_{p-1} is divisible by p², where F_n is the nth Fibonacci number. It is unknown whether any such primes exist.",
  "implication_form": "If there exists a prime p such that F_{p-1} ≡ 0 (mod p²), then a Wall–Sun–Sun prime exists.",

  "explained": "A Wall–Sun–Sun prime is a prime number p > 5 that satisfies a specific condition related to the Fibonacci sequence. It is defined by the congruence: F_{p - (p mod 5)} ≡ 0 \\pmod{p^2}, where F_n denotes the nth Fibonacci number. This condition is analogous to the definition of a Wieferich prime (which relates to Fermat's Last Theorem) but applied to the Fibonacci sequence and modulo p squared. The existence of such primes is conjectured, although none have been found to date. The condition involves the Fibonacci entry point, which is the smallest positive integer k such that F_k ≡ 0 \\pmod{p}.",
