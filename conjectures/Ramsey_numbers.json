  "rephrased": "For any two colors and any two positive integers r and s, there exists a minimum number R(r, s) such that any complete graph with R(r, s) vertices, whose edges are colored with the two colors, must contain a monochromatic clique of size r or s.",
  "implication_form": "If a complete graph with at least R(r, s) vertices is edge-colored with two colors, then it contains a monochromatic clique of size r or s.",

  "explained": "Ramsey's theorem, in its basic graph-theoretic form, asserts that for any two positive integers r and s, there exists a minimal integer R(r, s) such that any complete graph with at least R(r, s) vertices, whose edges are colored with two colors (e.g., blue and red), must contain either a blue complete subgraph (clique) on r vertices or a red complete subgraph on s vertices. This R(r, s) is known as the Ramsey number for r and s.",
