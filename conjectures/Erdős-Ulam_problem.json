  "summary": "The Erdős–Ulam problem asks whether a set of points in the plane can be both topologically dense and have all pairwise distances be rational numbers. It is an open problem, but a negative answer (meaning no such set exists) is expected to follow from the Bombieri–Lang conjecture or the abc conjecture. ",
  "head": "A set \\(S\\) in the plane (\\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\)) has the property that for any two points \\(p_{i},p_{j}\\in S\\), their Euclidean distance \\(d(p_{i},p_{j})\\) is a rational number.",
  "tail": "The set \\(S\\) is not a topologically dense set in the plane (meaning its closure is not the entire plane). ",
