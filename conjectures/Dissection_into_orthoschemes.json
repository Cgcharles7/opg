  "summary": "Dissection into orthoschemes refers to the mathematical concept of cutting a geometric shape, such as a simplex, into smaller pieces called orthoschemes. An orthoscheme is a specific type of tetrahedron with right dihedral angles at two opposite vertices. The most famous problem in this area is the conjecture that every simplex can be dissected into a finite number of orthoschemes. ",
