  "name": "Rota's basis conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rota%27s_basis_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Given a collection of n disjoint bases in a vector space (or matroid of rank n), it is possible to arrange the elements into an n by n matrix such that each row forms one of the bases and each column also forms a basis.",
  "implication_form": "If there exists a vector space (or matroid) of rank n containing n disjoint bases, then these bases can be arranged into an n × n matrix where each row and each column is a basis.",
  "posed_by": "Gian-Carlo Rota",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": "unsolved for about 50 years",
  "explained": "Rota's basis conjecture states that for any vector space of dimension n or more generally for any matroid of rank n, if there are n disjoint bases (each containing n elements), then it is possible to arrange the elements of these bases into an n × n matrix such that each row forms one of the given bases, and each column also forms a basis.",
