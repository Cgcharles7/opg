  "name": "Toida's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toida%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "A conjecture about the labeling of cubic graphs, refining Ádám's earlier conjecture which was disproven.",
  "implication_form": "If a graph satisfies certain conditions (not specified here), then it must be isomorphic to a specific type of cubic graph (not specified here).",
  "posed_by": "Shunichi Toida",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 47,
  "explained": "Toida's conjecture states that a tournament (a complete graph with directed edges) with an odd number of vertices has a cyclic rotational symmetry if and only if the number of vertices is a power of 2. In other words, such a tournament admits a cyclic group of automorphisms acting regularly (i.e., transitively and freely) if and only if the order of the tournament is a power of 2.",
