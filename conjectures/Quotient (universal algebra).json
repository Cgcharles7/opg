  "summary": "In mathematics, a quotient algebra is the result of partitioning the elements of an algebraic structure using a congruence relation.\nQuotient algebras are also called factor algebras. Here, the congruence relation must be an equivalence relation that is additionally compatible with all the operations of the algebra, in the formal sense described below.\nIts equivalence classes partition the elements of the given algebraic structure. The quotient algebra has these classes as its elements, and the ",
