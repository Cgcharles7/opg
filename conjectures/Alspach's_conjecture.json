  "summary": "A mathematical theorem known as Alspach's conjecture describes the disjoint cycle covers of complete graphs with certain cycle lengths. It bears Brian Alspach's name, who first proposed it as a research question in 1981. Darryn Bryant, Daniel Horsley, and William Pettersson (2014) published a proof.",
