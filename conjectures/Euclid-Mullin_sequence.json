  "summary": "A Euclid–Mullin sequence is a sequence of distinct prime numbers where each term is the smallest prime factor of 1 plus the product of all previous terms. The sequence is based on Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes and is a constructive way to generate an infinite sequence of primes, but it is not known if every prime number will eventually appear in the sequence.
