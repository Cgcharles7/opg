  "rephrased": "A sequence of distinct primes begins with 2, and each subsequent term is the smallest prime factor of the product of all previous terms plus one.",
  "implication_form": "If a sequence is generated by taking the smallest prime factor of (1 + the product of all previous terms), then all terms are prime.",

  "explained": "The Euclid–Mullin sequence is a specific sequence defined by the following rule: It starts with the prime number 2. Each subsequent term is the smallest prime factor of the number (1 plus the product of all the previous terms). Formally, if the sequence is denoted as p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., then p_1 = 2, and for n >= 2, p_n is the smallest prime factor of (1 + ∏_{i=1}^{n-1} p_i). This sequence is infinite, as shown by its construction based on Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes, but it is not known whether every prime number will eventually appear in the sequence.",
