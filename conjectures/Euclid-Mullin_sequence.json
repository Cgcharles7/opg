  "summary": "The Euclid–Mullin sequence is an infinite sequence of distinct prime numbers, in which each element is the least prime factor of one plus the product of all earlier elements. They are named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, because their definition relies on an idea in Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many primes, and after Albert A. Mullin, who asked about the sequence in 1963.\nThe first 51 elements of the sequence are\n\n2, 3, 7, 43, 13, 53, 5, 6221671, 38709183810571, 139, 2",
