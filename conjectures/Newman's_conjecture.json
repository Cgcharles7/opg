  "rephrased": "The partition function p(n), which counts the number of ways to write n as a sum of positive integers, is equidistributed modulo any integer m. This means that for any modulus m and any residue r between 0 and m-1, there are infinitely many positive integers n such that p(n) modulo m equals r.",
  "implication_form": "If m is any positive integer, then for any residue r modulo m, there are infinitely many positive integers n such that p(n) ≡ r (mod m).",
  "posed_by": "Newman",
  "solved_by": "Ken Ono",
  "year_originated": 40,
  "explained": "Newman's conjecture, now a theorem, pertains to the partition function p(n), which counts the number of ways to write n as a sum of positive integers. It states that for any positive integer m and any integer r satisfying 0 ≤ r ≤ m-1, there exist infinitely many positive integers n such that the partition function p(n) is congruent to r modulo m. In other words, the partition function is equidistributed modulo any integer m.",
