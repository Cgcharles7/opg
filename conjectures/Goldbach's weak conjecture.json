  "summary": "In number theory, Goldbach's weak conjecture, also known as the odd Goldbach conjecture, the ternary Goldbach problem, or the 3-primes problem, is the proposition that every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes. (A prime may be used more than once in the same sum.)\nThis conjecture is called \"weak\" because it has been shown that a proof for Goldbach's strong conjecture (concerning sums of two primes) would have this weak conjecture as a corollary, since, if every ",
