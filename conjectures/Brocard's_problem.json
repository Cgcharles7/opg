  "summary": "When {\displaystyle n!} is the factorial, Brocard's problem is a mathematical problem that looks for integer values of {\displaystyle n} such that {\displaystyle n!+1} is a perfect square. There are only three known values for {\displaystyle n}: 4, 5, 7, and it is unknown if there are any others. There are no more solutions to the equation n! + 1 = m2, despite the fact that research has gone well beyond n > 7.<br><br>Formally speaking, it looks for instances of the integer pairings {\displaystyle n} and {\displaystyle m} such that {\displaystyle n!+1=m^{2}.}Henri Brocard presented the issue in two articles in 1876 and 1885 [1][2], while Srinivasa Ramanujan did it on his own in 1913.[3]",
