  "explained": "Brocard's problem is an unsolved conjecture in number theory that asks for all pairs of positive integers (n, m) such that n! + 1 is a perfect square (m²). It was formulated by Henri Brocard in 1876 and later considered by Srinivasa Ramanujan in 1913. The known solutions are (n, m) = (4, 5), (5, 11), and (7, 71).",
