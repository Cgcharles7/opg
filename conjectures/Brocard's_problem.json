  "summary": "Brocard's problem is an unsolved number theory problem that asks for all integer solutions to the equation \\(n!+1=m^{2}\\). It was independently posed by Henri Brocard in 1876 and Srinivasa Ramanujan in 1913. The only known solutions are the pairs \\((n,m)=(4,5)\\), \\((5,11)\\), and \\((7,71)\\). It is unknown if any other solutions exist. ",
