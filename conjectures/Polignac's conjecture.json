  "summary": "In number theory, Polignac's conjecture was made by Alphonse de Polignac in 1849 and states:\n\nFor any positive even number n, there are infinitely many prime gaps of size n. In other words: There are infinitely many cases of two consecutive prime numbers with difference n.\nFormally, the conjecture may be stated as follows: for any even k,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n          lim\n          \n            n\n            →\n            ∞\n          \n        \n        inf\n        \n          g\n     ",
