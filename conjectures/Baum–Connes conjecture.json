  "summary": "In mathematics, specifically in operator K-theory, the Baum–Connes conjecture suggests a link between the K-theory of the  reduced C*-algebra of a group and the K-homology of the classifying space of proper actions of that group. The conjecture sets up a correspondence between different areas of mathematics, with the K-homology of the classifying space being related to geometry, differential operator theory, and homotopy theory, while the K-theory of the group's reduced C*-algebra is a purely an",
