  "summary": "In mathematics, especially in the area of modern algebra known as combinatorial group theory, Nielsen transformations are certain automorphisms of a free group which are a non-commutative analogue of row reduction and one of the main tools used in studying free groups (Fine, Rosenberger & Stille 1995).\nGiven a finite basis of a free group \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F_{n}}\n  \n, the corresponding set of elementar",
