  "explained": "The Sphere Packing Conjecture, often referred to in relation to the Kepler conjecture, addresses the problem of arranging identical spheres in three-dimensional Euclidean space to achieve the maximum possible density. It states that the maximum density achievable is approximately 74.05% (π/(3√2) ≈ 0.7405), and this maximum can be attained by packing the spheres in a face-centered cubic (FCC) or hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattice arrangement. These arrangements are known to achieve the highest packing density.",
