  "explained": "The Williamson conjecture states that Williamson matrices exist for all positive integers n. A Williamson matrix of order n is a set of four symmetric circulant matrices A, B, C, D with entries from {1, -1} satisfying specific conditions. Specifically, these matrices must satisfy A · Aᵀ = A · A = nI, B · Bᵀ = B · B = nI, C · Cᵀ = C · C = nI, D · Dᵀ = D · D = nI, and also A · Bᵀ = A · B = 0, A · Cᵀ = A · C = 0, A · Dᵀ = A · D = 0, B · Cᵀ = B · C = 0, B · Dᵀ = B · D = 0, and C · Dᵀ = C · D = 0. The conjecture asserts that such matrices exist for all orders n.",
