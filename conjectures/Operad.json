  "summary": "In mathematics, an operad is a structure that consists of abstract operations, each one having a fixed finite number of inputs (arguments) and one output, as well as a specification of how to compose these operations. Given an operad \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O}\n  \n, one defines an algebra over \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O}\n  \n to be a set together with concrete operations on this set which behave just like the abstract operations of \n",
