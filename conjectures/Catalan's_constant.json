  "summary": "Catalan's constant, denoted by \\(G\\), is a mathematical constant defined by the infinite series \\(1-\\frac{1}{3^{2}}+\\frac{1}{5^{2}}-\\frac{1}{7^{2}}+\\dots \\). Its approximate value is \\(0.9159659...\\) and it appears in various areas of mathematics, including geometry, number theory, and combinatorics. The constant is named after the mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan and it is not yet known if it is a rational number. ",
