  "summary": "Erdős' conjecture on arithmetic progressions, often referred to as the Erdős–Turán conjecture, is a conjecture in arithmetic combinatorics (not to be confused with the Erdős–Turán conjecture on additive bases). It states that if the sum of the reciprocals of the members of a set A of positive integers diverges, then A contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.\nFormally, the conjecture states that if A is a large set in the sense that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∑\n          \n      ",
