  "year_originated": 70,
  "explained": "The Kobon triangle problem seeks the maximum number of nonoverlapping triangles that can be formed by an arrangement of k lines in the Euclidean plane. The triangles must have their sides lying entirely on the lines of the arrangement and must not overlap with each other. The maximum number for k lines is denoted by N(k).",
