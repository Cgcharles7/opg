  "summary": "In mathematics, Szymanski's conjecture, named after Ted H. Szymanski (1989), states that every permutation on the n-dimensional doubly directed hypercube graph can be routed with edge-disjoint paths. That is, if the permutation σ matches each vertex v to another vertex σ(v), then for each v there exists a path in the hypercube graph from v to σ(v) such that no two paths for two different vertices u and v use the same edge in the same direction.\nThrough computer experiments it has been verified t",
