  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymanski%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "In a bidirectional n-dimensional hypercube graph, any permutation of the vertices can be decomposed into edge-disjoint directed paths from each vertex to its image.",
  "implication_form": "If there exists a permutation on the vertices of an n-dimensional doubly directed hypercube graph, then there exist edge-disjoint directed paths from each vertex to its image.",
  "posed_by": "Ted H. Szymanski",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 34,
  "explained": "Szymanski's conjecture, named after Ted H. Szymanski and formulated in 1989, states that for the n-dimensional doubly directed hypercube graph (where vertices represent all binary strings of length n, and edges exist in both directions between vertices differing in exactly one bit), every permutation σ of its vertices can be realized by a set of edge-disjoint directed paths. Specifically, for each vertex v, there exists a directed path from v to σ(v), and no two such paths share an edge in the same direction.",
