  "name": "Birch–Tate conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch%E2%80%93Tate_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The size (order) of the K2 group for a totally real number field's ring of integers is mathematically linked to the value of its Dedekind zeta function at s=-1.",
  "implication_form": "If the absolute value of the Dedekind zeta function ζ_F(-1) (adjusted by a power of 2) equals the order of the K2 group K₂(O_F), then the Birch–Tate conjecture holds.",
  "posed_by": "B Birch and J Tate",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 60,
  "explained": "The Birch–Tate conjecture, formulated for a totally real number field F, proposes that the order (the number of elements) of the algebraic K-group K₂(𝒪_F) (where 𝒱_F is the ring of integers of F) is equal in absolute value to the value of the Dedekind zeta function ζ_F(s) evaluated at s = -1, adjusted by a power of two. This conjecture remains unproven in general but has been confirmed for specific cases.",
