  "summary": "The Birch–Tate conjecture is a proposal in algebraic K-theory that relates the value of the Dedekind zeta-function of a totally real number field to the order of its K2-group. It states that the order of the algebraic K2-group of the ring of integers for a totally real number field is equal to the absolute value of the zeta-function evaluated at \\(-1\\), potentially with a power of two adjustment. This conjecture has been confirmed for certain cases but remains an open problem in mathematics. ",
  "head": ["The order (number of elements) of the algebraic K-group \\(K_{2}(\\mathcal{O}_{F})\\) of the ring of integers \\(\\mathcal{O}_{F}\\) of a totally real number field \\(F\\) is a certain value.", "The value of the Dedekind zeta function \\(\\zeta _{F}(s)\\) of the field \\(F\\) at \\(s=-1\\) is related to the order of the \\(K_{2}\\) group by a specific formula involving a power of 2 and some other factors. ",
