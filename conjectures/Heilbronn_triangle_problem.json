  "name": "Heilbronn triangle problem",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heilbronn_triangle_problem",
  "rephrased": "Can we place n points in a unit area such that the smallest triangle formed by any three points has area at most 1/n²?",
  "implication_form": "If n points are placed in a unit area, then there exists a triangle formed by three of those points with area at most 1/n².",
  "posed_by": "Hans Heilbronn",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 80,
  "explained": "The Heilbronn triangle problem concerns the minimum area of the smallest triangle formed by any three points when n points are placed within a fixed area, typically the unit disk. Hans Heilbronn conjectured that this minimum area, denoted min_area(n), would satisfy min_area(n) ≤ C / n² for some constant C depending only on the area (e.g., the unit disk). However, this conjecture was disproven in 2005 by Komlós, Pach, and Szemerédi, who showed that Heilbronn's constant C does not exist; the minimum area can be larger than any constant divided by n². Despite this, the exact asymptotic growth rate of min_area(n) as n tends to infinity remains unknown. The problem is to determine the precise asymptotic behavior of the minimum triangle area for n points in a fixed area.",
