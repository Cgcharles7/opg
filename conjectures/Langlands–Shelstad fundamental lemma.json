  "summary": "In the mathematical theory of automorphic forms, the  fundamental lemma relates orbital integrals on a reductive group over a local field to stable orbital integrals on its endoscopic groups. It was conjectured by Robert Langlands (1983) in the course of developing the Langlands program.  The fundamental lemma was proved by Gérard Laumon and Ngô Bảo Châu in the case of unitary groups and then by Ngô (2010) for general reductive groups, building on a series of important reductions made by Jean-Lo",
