  "summary": "An arithmetic progression, arithmetic sequence or linear sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference from any succeeding term to its preceding term remains constant throughout the sequence. The constant difference is called common difference of that arithmetic progression. For instance, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, . . . is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2.\nIf the initial term of an arithmetic progression is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n        ",
