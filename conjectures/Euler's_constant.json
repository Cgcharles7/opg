  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_constant",
  "summary": "Euler's number (\\(e\\)) is crucial because it is the natural base for exponential growth and decay, which makes it a fundamental constant in fields like calculus, finance, and science. Its importance stems from the unique property that the exponential function \\(e^{x}\\) is equal to its own derivative, making it the natural \"language\" for calculus, as it simplifies equations that model rates of change.  ",
