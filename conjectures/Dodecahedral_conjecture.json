  "summary": "The Dodecahedral Conjecture is a geometric statement that the Voronoi cell of a unit sphere in a sphere packing is at least as large as a regular dodecahedron with an inradius of one. This means that in any packing of equal spheres, the volume of the space surrounding one sphere is at its minimum when the spheres are arranged in a way that the surrounding space is a dodecahedral shape. This conjecture, originally proposed by László Fejes Tóth in 1943, was proven by Thomas Hales and Sean McLaughlin in 1998, using techniques similar to those developed for the Kepler conjecture. ",
