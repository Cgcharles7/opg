  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedral_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "In any packing of identical spheres, the volume of the space surrounding a single sphere is minimized when the shape of that space is a regular dodecahedron.",
  "implication_form": "If there exists a packing of unit spheres in three-dimensional Euclidean space, then the volume of the Voronoi cell associated with any sphere is at least the volume of a regular dodecahedron with inradius one.",
  "posed_by": "László Fejes Tóth",
  "solved_by": "Thomas Hales and Sean McLaughlin",
  "year_originated": 80,
  "explained": "The Dodecahedral Conjecture states that in any packing of congruent unit spheres in three-dimensional Euclidean space, the volume of the Voronoi cell associated with each sphere is at least the volume of a regular dodecahedron with an inradius of one.",
