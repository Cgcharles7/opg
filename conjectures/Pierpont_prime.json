  "name": "Pierpont prime",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierpont_prime",
  "rephrased": "Pierpont primes are prime numbers that can be written as 2 raised to some nonnegative integer power u, multiplied by 3 raised to some nonnegative integer power v, and then adding one.",
  "implication_form": "There is no 'If P, then Q' form because the definition itself states the condition for a number to be a Pierpont prime.",
  "posed_by": "James Pierpont",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 120,
  "explained": "In number theory, a Pierpont prime is a prime number of the form 2ᵘ * 3ᵛ + 1 for some nonnegative integers u and v. That is, they are the prime numbers p for which p − 1 is a 3-smooth number (i.e., its prime factors are only 2 and 3). They are named after the mathematician James Pierpont, who used them to characterize polygons that can be constructed with compass, straightedge, and a marked ruler (also known as a straightedge and compass with a fixed angle).",
