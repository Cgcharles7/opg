It posits that for any finite partially ordered set (poset) that is not already totally ordered (i.e., it has multiple linear extensions), there exists at least one pair of elements (x, y) such that, in the set of all possible linear extensions (total orders consistent with the partial order), the proportion of extensions where x precedes y is strictly between 1/3 and 2/3. In other words, no single element pair has a 'decisive' ordering across nearly all linear extensions; there is always some pair whose relative order is unresolved by the partial order in a balanced way (between 1/3 and 2/3 of the possibilities). This property is significant in comparison models for sorting, as it guarantees the existence of a comparison that significantly reduces the number of possible sorted outcomes (linear extensions).",

The norm of a Gaussian integer a + bi, defined as N(a + bi) = a² + b², plays a crucial role: if π is a Gaussian prime, then its norm N(π) is a prime number in the integers or the square of a prime number in the integers (but π itself is not the square of another Gaussian integer).

It suggests that the cohomology of certain motivic complexes (complexes constructed from algebraic varieties using motives, which are universal co-cycles) associated with a smooth projective variety over a field (often assumed to be the complex numbers or the rationals) coincides precisely with specific components or 'pieces' of the algebraic K-theory of that variety. Algebraic K-theory is a sophisticated invariant of algebraic varieties that encodes information about linear algebra structures over the variety. The conjecture essentially states that the motivic cohomology groups, which are fundamental in algebraic geometry, provide a complete description of the structure of the algebraic K-groups, at least in certain 'weight' or degree components. This conjecture significantly extends the earlier conjectures formulated by Don Zagier around 1991 regarding special values of zeta functions and multiple zeta values, linking them to algebraic K-theory and motivic structures.",

The conjecture states that if a linear ODE with coefficients in the field of rational functions on a complex variety satisfies two conditions: 1) It is 'p-curvature flat' at every point (meaning the p-curvature, a certain invariant from differential Galois theory, vanishes at every point), and 2) It satisfies a specific 'p-adic integrability' condition related to being defined over the ring of integers in a p-adic number field for almost all primes p, then the monodromy representation (the way solutions change when circumnavigating singularities) must be unipotent. In simpler terms, the conjecture posits that the vanishing of the p-curvature at all points (a local condition) and the existence of a suitable p-adic model (a global condition) imply that the monodromy is unipotent. Despite significant progress, particularly linking it to the theory of p-adic differential equations and the work of André, Blickle, and others, a complete proof for the general case remains elusive.",

The Hausdorff dimension is often strictly greater than the topological dimension of the set, reflecting its 'fractal' nature. For example, a smooth curve has Hausdorff dimension equal to its topological dimension (1), while a fractal curve might have a Hausdorff dimension greater than 1.",

It states that for any algebraic number field K, any prime number p, and any sufficiently large integer n, the p-adic regulator (an analogue of the classical regulator defined using p-adic logarithms introduced by Leopoldt himself) does not vanish. This means that the p-adic regulator is a non-zero element in the ring of p-adic integers, indicating that the units in the ring of integers of K have a specific p-adic logarithmic independence property. The conjecture is crucial as it implies that the p-adic logarithm map from the group of units modulo roots of unity to the p-adic logarithm of the ideal class group has full rank.",

Its central aim is to provide a structure theorem for the set `pcf(S)` for any set `S` of regular cardinals. The theory culminates in the 'pcf theorem,' which guarantees the existence of a 'supporting' set of functions and an associated 'good' ultrapower embedding that captures the structure of `pcf(S)`. A key consequence is the 'theorem on the size of the continuum' (or more generally, bounding the power set of singular cardinals). Specifically, for any singular cardinal `λ`, the size of its power set `2^λ` is bounded by the maximum of `λ^cf(λ)` and the `pcf(S)` structure for `S` being the set of cofinality of all singular cardinals below `λ` or related sets. This theory provides deep upper bounds on the continuum function at singular cardinals, significantly advancing our understanding beyond results like Easton's theorem for regular cardinals.",

This implies the decomposition of cohomology into primitive parts.\n\n2.  **The Hard Lefschetz Type Conjecture (Conjecture dite \"Hard Lefschetz\"):** For a smooth projective variety X over a field of characteristic zero and a divisor D (or hyperplane section), the Lefschetz operator L^k (k! times the class of D^k) induces an isomorphism between the primitive cohomology groups P^k(X) and P^{n-k}(X) (or a related isomorphism).\n\n3.  **The Hodge Type Conjecture (Conjecture de Hodge):** This states that for a smooth projective variety X over the complex numbers, the Hodge classes in its cohomology (classes that can be written as intersections of algebraic cycles) are spanned by the classes of algebraic cycles. This is actually the Hodge Conjecture itself, but Grothendieck formulated it as a Standard Conjecture in the Weil cohomology setting.\n\n4.  **The Tate Type Conjecture (Conjecture de Tate):** For a smooth projective variety X over a field F which is finitely generated over its prime field, and for any Weil cohomology theory, the cycle map from algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence to the cohomology groups, tensored with Q, becomes an isomorphism after tensoring with Q and extending the coefficients appropriately (e.g., Q, Q(l), Z(l), depending on the context). This conjecture also holds for numerical equivalence in many cases. It generalizes the Hodge Conjecture (over C) and the Tate Conjecture (over finite fields).\n\nThese conjectures are fundamental to the theory of motives, which Grothendieck hoped would provide a universal cohomology theory for algebraic varieties. The Standard Conjectures describe essential properties that any such universal cohomology theory (the category of motives) should satisfy.",

The boundaries between regions (Voronoi edges) are the set of points equidistant to two or more seeds, and these boundaries intersect at points equidistant to three or more seeds (Voronoi vertices). Voronoi diagrams are a form of tessellation, meaning they partition the entire plane.

The Willmore energy, denoted by 𝒪, is defined for any closed surface Σ embedded in R³ as an integral quantity: 𝒪(Σ) = ∫_Σ (|A|² - 2|H|⁴) dA, where A is the second fundamental form, H is the mean curvature vector, and dA is the area element.

    "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmer%27s_conjecture",
    "rephrased": "Higher-rank lattices (a type of symmetry) cannot act on geometric spaces of lower dimension than their rank.",
    "implication_form": "If a geometric space admits a higher-rank lattice symmetry, then the space must be of dimension at least the rank of the lattice.",

    "year_originated": 35,
    "explained": "Zimmer's conjecture states that there is a function, depending on the rank of the lattice and the dimension of the space, such that any action of a higher-rank lattice (e.g., SL(n, Z) for n ≥ 3) on a compact manifold that preserves a rigid geometric structure (such as a Riemannian metric, symplectic form, or complex structure) must be essentially algebraic (or induced by a linear representation) if the dimension of the manifold is sufficiently large. In other words, higher-rank lattices cannot act faithfully and effectively on compact manifolds of dimension less than some bound depending on the lattice's rank, unless the action is highly structured (e.g., preserves a foliation or is induced by a representation).",
