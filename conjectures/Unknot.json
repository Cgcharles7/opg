  "summary": "In the mathematical theory of knots, the unknot, not knot, or trivial knot, is the least knotted of all knots.  Intuitively, the unknot is a closed loop of rope without a knot tied into it, unknotted.  To a knot theorist, an unknot is any embedded topological circle in the 3-sphere that is ambient isotopic (that is, deformable) to a geometrically round circle, the standard unknot.\nThe unknot is the only knot that is the boundary of an embedded disk, which gives the characterization that only unk",
