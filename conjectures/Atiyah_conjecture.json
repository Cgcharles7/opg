  "summary": "Michael Atiyah introduced the {\\displaystyle l^{2}}-cohomology of manifolds with a discrete countable group's free co-compact action in 1976. This includes the universal cover of a compact manifold and the basic group's action through deck transformations. Atiyah calculated multiple examples, all of which proved to be rational numbers, and defined {\\displaystyle l^{2}}-Betti numbers as von Neumann dimensions of the resulting {\\displaystyle l^{2}}-cohomology groups. Thus, he inquired as to whether {\\displaystyle l^{2}}-Betti numbers may be irrational.<br><br>Since then, a number of scholars have posed more specific queries regarding the values of {\\displaystyle l^{2}}-Betti numbers, which are collectively known as the \"Atiyah conjecture.\"",
