  "name": "Atiyah conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiyah_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Are the l²-Betti numbers, defined as von Neumann dimensions of l²-cohomology groups for spaces with a discrete countable group's free co-compact action, always rational numbers?",
  "implication_form": "null",
  "posed_by": "Michael Atiyah",
  "solved_by": "Unsolved in general (though solved in many specific cases)",
  "year_originated": 48,
  "explained": "The Atiyah conjecture concerns the rationality of l²-Betti numbers, which are invariants defined using l²-cohomology. It posits that for a compact manifold with a free, co-compact action by a discrete countable group, the l²-Betti numbers of the universal cover are rational numbers. Equivalently, it asks whether these invariants, defined via von Neumann dimensions, are always rational in this context.",
