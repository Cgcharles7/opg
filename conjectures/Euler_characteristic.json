  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic",
  "rephrased": "The Euler characteristic is a numerical value calculated from a shape's vertices, edges, and faces (V - E + F) and remains constant regardless of how the shape is smoothly deformed.",
  "implication_form": "If a shape is a polyhedron or a two-dimensional surface, then its Euler characteristic is given by the formula V - E + F.",
