  "summary": "The Euler characteristic is a number calculated by subtracting the number of edges from the number of vertices and adding the number of faces in a polyhedron or a 2D shape (\\(V-E+F\\)). It is a topological invariant, meaning it remains the same for shapes that can be deformed into one another without tearing or gluing. For example, the Euler characteristic for a simple convex polyhedron like a cube is \\(2\\), while for a simple polygon, it is \\(1\\).  ",
