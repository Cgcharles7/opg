  "summary": "In mathematics, a free module is a module that has a basis, that is, a generating set that is linearly independent. Every vector space is a free module, but, if the ring of the coefficients is not a division ring (not a field in the commutative case), then there exist non-free modules.\nGiven any set S and ring R, there is a free R-module with basis S, which is called the free module on S or module of formal R-linear combinations of the elements of S.\nA free abelian group is precisely a free modu",
