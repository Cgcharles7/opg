  "summary": "In set theory, a Reinhardt cardinal is a kind of large cardinal. Reinhardt cardinals are considered under ZF (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice), because they are inconsistent with ZFC (ZF with the Axiom of Choice). They were suggested (Reinhardt 1967, 1974) by American mathematician William Nelson Reinhardt (1939–1998).",
