  "summary": "In mathematics, assembly maps are an important concept in geometric topology. From the homotopy-theoretical viewpoint, an assembly map is a universal approximation of a homotopy invariant functor by a homology theory from the left. From the geometric viewpoint, assembly maps correspond to 'assemble' local data over a parameter space together to get global data.\nAssembly maps for algebraic K-theory and L-theory play a central role in the topology of high-dimensional manifolds, since their homotop",
