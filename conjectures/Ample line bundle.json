  "summary": "In mathematics, a distinctive feature of algebraic geometry is that some line bundles on a projective variety can be considered \"positive\", while others are \"negative\" (or a mixture of the two). The most important notion of positivity is that of an ample line bundle, although there are several related classes of line bundles. Roughly speaking, positivity properties of a line bundle are related to having many global sections. Understanding the ample line bundles on a given variety \n  \n    \n      ",
