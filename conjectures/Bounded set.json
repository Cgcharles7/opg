  "summary": "In mathematical analysis and related areas of mathematics, a set is called bounded if all of its points are within a certain distance of each other. Conversely, a set which is not bounded is called unbounded. The word \"bounded\" makes no sense in a general topological space without a corresponding metric.\nBoundary is a distinct concept; for example, a circle (not to be confused with a disk) in isolation is a boundaryless bounded set, while the half plane is unbounded yet has a boundary.\nA bounded",
