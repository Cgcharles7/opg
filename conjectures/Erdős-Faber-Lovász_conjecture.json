  "summary": "In graph theory, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture is a problem about graph coloring, named after Paul Erdős, Vance Faber, and László Lovász, who formulated it in 1972.  It says:\n\nIf k complete graphs, each having exactly k vertices, have the property that every pair of complete graphs has at most one shared vertex, then the union of the graphs can be properly colored with k colors.\nThe conjecture for all sufficiently large values of k was proved by Dong Yeap Kang, Tom Kelly, Daniela Kühn, Abhis",
