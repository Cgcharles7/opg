  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Faber%E2%80%93Lov%C3%A1sz_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "If a graph is formed by overlapping complete graphs (cliques) of size n, with each clique containing n vertices and any two cliques sharing at most one vertex, then the entire graph can be colored using only n colors.",
  "implication_form": "If a graph is the union of n complete subgraphs, each having exactly n vertices, and every pair of these complete subgraphs shares at most one common vertex, then the chromatic number of the graph is at most n.",
  "posed_by": "Paul Erdős, Zdeněk Faber, and Ágnes Szendrei (commonly known as Lovász)",
  "solved_by": "Kang, Kelly, and Liu",
  "year_originated": 51,
  "explained": "The Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture states that if a graph G is the union of n complete subgraphs (cliques), each containing exactly n vertices, and any two of these cliques share at most one vertex, then the chromatic number χ(G) is at most n.",
