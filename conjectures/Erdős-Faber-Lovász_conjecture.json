  "summary": "The Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture, proposed in 1972, states that for a set of \\(n\\) \"cliques\" (groups of \\(n\\) vertices) where any two cliques share at most one vertex, the union of these cliques can be properly colored using only \\(n\\) colors. It is equivalent to saying that any linear hypergraph with \\(n\\) vertices has a chromatic index of at most \\(n\\). Though initially thought to be simple, this conjecture remained a famous open problem for nearly 50 years until it was proven for sufficiently large \\(n\\). ",
  "head": "a graph \\(G\\) is the union of \\(n\\) complete subgraphs (cliques), each having exactly \\(n\\) vertices, such that every pair of these complete subgraphs shares at most one common vertex.", 
  "tail": "the vertices of the entire graph \\(G\\) can be properly colored using no more than \\(n\\) colors. ",
