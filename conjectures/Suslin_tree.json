  "summary": "In mathematics, a Suslin tree is a tree of height ω1 such that\nevery branch and every antichain is countable. They are named after Mikhail Yakovlevich Suslin.\nEvery Suslin tree is an Aronszajn tree.\nThe existence of a Suslin tree is independent of ZFC, and is equivalent to the existence of a Suslin line (shown by Kurepa (1935)) or a Suslin algebra. The diamond principle, a consequence of V=L,  implies that there is a Suslin tree, and Martin's axiom MA(ℵ1) implies that there are no Suslin trees.\n",
