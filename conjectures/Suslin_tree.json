  "explained": "A Suslin tree is a mathematical structure defined within set theory as a tree of height ω1 (the first uncountable ordinal) that satisfies two key properties: every chain (branch) is countable, and every antichain is countable. It is a specific type of Aronszajn tree, which is an uncountable tree with no uncountable chains or antichains, but unlike the general Aronszajn tree, the Suslin tree does not have a certain 'witnessing' property related to dense sets in the definition of a Suslin algebra.",
