  "summary": "In mathematics, the Bombieri窶天inogradov theorem (sometimes simply called Bombieri's theorem) is a major result of analytic number theory, obtained in the mid-1960s, concerning the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions, averaged over a range of moduli. The first result of this kind was obtained by Mark Barban in 1961 and the Bombieri窶天inogradov theorem is a refinement of Barban's result. The Bombieri窶天inogradov theorem is named after Enrico Bombieri and A. I. Vinogradov, who published",
