  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidorenko%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "For any bipartite graph H, the number of copies of H as a subgraph in a large graph G with n vertices and average degree pn is asymptotically at least (pn)^{|V(H)|} (where |V(H)| is the number of vertices in H).",
  "implication_form": "If G is a graph on n vertices with average degree pn, then the number of homomorphisms from H to G is asymptotically at least (pn)^{|V(H)|}.",
