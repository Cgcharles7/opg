  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidorenko%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "For any bipartite graph H, the number of copies of H as a subgraph in a large graph G with n vertices and average degree pn is asymptotically at least (pn)^{|V(H)|} (where |V(H)| is the number of vertices in H).",
  "implication_form": "If G is a graph on n vertices with average degree pn, then the number of homomorphisms from H to G is asymptotically at least (pn)^{|V(H)|}.",
  "posed_by": "Alexander Sidorenko",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 38,
  "explained": "Sidorenko's conjecture states that for any bipartite graph \\(H\\), the number of \"homomorphisms\" from \\(H\\) to a graph \\(G\\) is minimized when \\(G\\) is a \"pseudorandom\" or \"quasirandom\" graph with the same edge density. Informally, it suggests that the most \"efficient\" or common way to find copies of a bipartite graph \\(H\\) within another graph \\(G\\) is when \\(G\\) is as \"random-looking\" as possible. This has been proven for some specific classes of bipartite graphs, but remains a major open problem in graph theory. ",
