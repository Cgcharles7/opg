  "summary": "The class number problem is a historical question in number theory, primarily known as Gauss's class number problem, which seeks an effective algorithm to find all imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number, according to a PDF from Columbia University. It was completely solved for imaginary quadratic fields in 1985, but a related, harder problem for real quadratic fields remains open, as detailed in a UBC Library thesis. ",
