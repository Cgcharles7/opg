  "rephrased": "A Giuga number is a composite number that is divisible by the sum of its prime factors each raised to the power of their multiplicity, minus one, for each distinct prime factor.",
  "implication_form": "If n is a composite number such that for every distinct prime factor p of n, p divides (n/p - 1), then n is a Giuga number.",
  "posed_by": "Giuseppe Giuga",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 70,
  "explained": "In number theory, a Giuga number is a composite number \\( n \\) that satisfies the following condition: for every distinct prime factor \\( p_i \\) of \\( n \\), \\( p_i \\) divides \\( \\left( \\frac{n}{p_i} - 1 \\right) \\). This property defines a specific class of composite numbers rather than posing a traditional conjecture about unproven statements. The definition itself is the core concept, and the search for and characterization of such numbers form the subject matter.",
