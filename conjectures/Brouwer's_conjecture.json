  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "For any finite simple graph, the sum of its k largest Laplacian eigenvalues is bounded above by the number of edges plus the number of edges in a complete graph on k vertices.",
  "implication_form": "If G is a finite simple graph with n vertices, m edges, and Laplacian eigenvalues λ₁ ≥ λ₂ ≥ … ≥ λₙ, then for any k between 1 and n, the sum of the k largest eigenvalues (λ₁ + λ₂ + … + λₖ) is less than or equal to m + C(k+1, 2), where C denotes the binomial coefficient.",

  "explained": "Brouwer's conjecture is an open problem in spectral graph theory. It proposes an upper bound for the sum of the k largest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of a finite simple graph. The conjecture states that for a graph G with n vertices and m edges, the sum of its k largest Laplacian eigenvalues (λ₁ ≥ λ₂ ≥ … ≥ λₙ) is at most m + \\binom{k+1}{2} for all k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n. This conjecture has been verified for specific classes of graphs like trees and certain planar graphs but remains unproven in general.",
