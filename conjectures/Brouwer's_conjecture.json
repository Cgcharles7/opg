  "summary": "A conjecture by Andries Brouwer on upper bounds for the intermediate sums of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian of a graph in terms of its edge count is known as Brouwer's conjecture in the mathematical field of spectral graph theory.[1]<br><br>The hypothesis asserts that if L(G) is the Laplacian matrix and G is a simple undirected graph, then its eigenvalues λn(L(G)) < \lambda n−1(L(G)) ≤... ≤ \lambda1(L(G)) fulfill (L(G)) \leq m(G)+\left({\begin{array}{c}t+1\\2\end{array}}\right),\quad t=1,\ldots,n}, where m(G) is the number of edges of G.",
