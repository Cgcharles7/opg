  "summary": "Brouwer's conjecture, a significant statement in spectral graph theory, proposes an upper bound for the sum of the \\(k\\) largest eigenvalues of a graph's Laplacian matrix. Specifically, it states that for a graph \\(G\\) with \\(n\\) vertices and \\(m\\) edges, the sum of its \\(k\\) largest Laplacian eigenvalues is less than or equal to \\(m+{k+1 \\choose 2}\\) for \\(1\\le k\\le n\\). The conjecture has been verified for many types of graphs, such as trees and planar graphs in certain cases, and is an active area of research. ",
  "head": "\\(G\\) is a finite simple graph with \\(n\\) vertices and \\(m\\) edges, and \\(\\lambda _{1}\\ge \\lambda _{2}\\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda _{n}\\) are its Laplacian eigenvalues.",
