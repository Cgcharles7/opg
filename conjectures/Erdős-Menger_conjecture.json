  "summary": "The Erdős–Menger conjecture is a graph theory statement that extends Menger's theorem to infinite graphs. It states that for any infinite graph, if you have two sets of vertices, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), there exists a set of disjoint \\(A-B\\) paths and a corresponding separator set of one vertex from each path. The conjecture was proven to be true for infinite graphs in its entirety, and the result is now known as the Erdős–Menger theorem. ",
  "head": "\\(G\\) is an infinite graph with given vertex sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)", 
  "tail": "there exists a set \\(P\\) of disjoint \\(A\\)-\\(B\\) paths in \\(G\\) and an \\(A\\)-\\(B\\) separator \\(X\\) (a set of vertices that every \\(A\\)-\\(B\\) path must intersect) such that \\(X\\) consists of precisely one vertex from each path in \\(P\\)",
