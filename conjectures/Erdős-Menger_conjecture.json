  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger%27s_theorem",
  "summary": "In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, Menger's theorem says that in a finite graph, the size of a minimum cut set is equal to the maximum number of disjoint paths that can be found between any pair of vertices.\nProved by Karl Menger in 1927, it characterizes the connectivity of a graph.\nIt is generalized by the max-flow min-cut theorem, which is a weighted, edge version, and which in turn is a special case of the strong duality theorem for linear programs.",
