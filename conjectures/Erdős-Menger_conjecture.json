  "name": "Erdős–Menger conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger%27s_theorem",
  "rephrased": "In any infinite graph, if there are two distinct sets of vertices, there exist infinitely many vertex-disjoint paths connecting them, and a way to 'separate' these paths by selecting one vertex from each path.",
  "implication_form": "If G is an infinite graph and A, B are two distinct vertex sets in G, then there exist infinitely many vertex-disjoint A-B paths, and there exists a set of vertices (one from each path) that separates these paths.",
  "posed_by": "Paul Erdős and Karl Menger",
  "solved_by": "Reinhard Halin",
  "year_originated": 55,
  "explained": "The Erdős–Menger conjecture states: For any infinite graph G and any two distinct vertices or vertex sets A and B in G, there exists a collection of vertex-disjoint paths connecting A to B, and there also exists a corresponding set of vertices (called an A-B separator) that intersects each of these paths exactly once. This conjecture provided a profound extension of Menger's theorem from finite to infinite graphs and was later proven to be true, becoming the Erdős–Menger theorem.",
