  "explained": "The Erdős–Hajnal conjecture states that for any graph H, there exists a constant c > 0 such that every graph G that does not contain H as an induced subgraph has either a clique (complete subgraph) or an independent set (stable set) of size at least |V(G)|^c. This means that forbidding a specific graph pattern as an induced subgraph guarantees the existence of a very large clique or independent set, exhibiting polynomial growth in the size of the graph. The conjecture has been proven for specific graphs H, such as the 5-cycle.",
