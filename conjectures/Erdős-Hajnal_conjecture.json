  "summary": "The Erdős–Hajnal conjecture states that for any graph \\(H\\), there exists a constant \\(c>0\\) such that every graph \\(G\\) that does not contain \\(H\\) as an induced subgraph has either a clique or a stable set (independent set) of size at least \\(|V(G)|^{c}\\). In simpler terms, forbidding a specific graph pattern as an induced subgraph guarantees the existence of a very large clique or stable set, which is a polynomial-sized substructure. This is a major open problem in graph theory, though it has been proven for some specific graphs \\(H\\), such as the 5-cycle. ",
  "head": "a graph has a minimum degree of at least three (\\(p\\))", 
  "tail": "it contains a simple cycle whose length is a power of two (\\(q\\)). ",
