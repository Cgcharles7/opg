  "summary": "The Erdős–Turán conjecture states that if a set of integers \\(A\\) is an additive basis of order 2 (meaning every natural number can be written as the sum of at most two elements from \\(A\\)), then the number of ways each integer can be represented as a sum of two elements from \\(A\\) must be unbounded. In other words, there must be integers that can be written as a sum of two elements from \\(A\\) in arbitrarily many ways. ",
  "head": "A set \\(A\\) of non-negative integers is an asymptotic additive base of order 2 (meaning every sufficiently large integer \\(N\\) can be represented as a sum \\(a+b\\) with \\(a,b\\in A\\) at least once).",
  "tail": "The number of representations of \\(N\\) as \\(a+b\\) with \\(a,b\\in A\\) (often denoted as \\(R_{A}(N)\\)) is unbounded as \\(N\\rightarrow \\infty \\) (i.e., \\(\\limsup _{N\\rightarrow \\infty }R_{A}(N)=\\infty \\)). ",
