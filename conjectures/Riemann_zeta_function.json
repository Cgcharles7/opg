  "name": "Riemann zeta function",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function",
  "rephrased": "The Riemann zeta function is defined for complex numbers s with a real part greater than 1 by a specific infinite series. The famous Riemann Hypothesis, which is the core conjecture here, states that all non-trivial zeros of this function have a real part of exactly 1/2.",
  "implication_form": "If a complex number is a non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function, then its real part is 1/2.",
  "posed_by": "Bernhard Riemann",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 164,
  "explained": "The Riemann zeta function, denoted by ζ(s), is a central mathematical function in complex analysis and number theory. For complex numbers s with real part greater than 1, it is defined by the absolutely convergent Dirichlet series: ζ(s) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^s. This function can be analytically continued to the entire complex plane (except for a simple pole at s = 1). Its zeros are deeply connected to the distribution of prime numbers, and the famous Riemann Hypothesis, which remains unproven, conjectures that all non-trivial zeros lie on the critical line with real part 1/2.",
