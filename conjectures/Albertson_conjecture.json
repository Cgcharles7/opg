  "name": "Albertson conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertson_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Among all graphs requiring n colors, the complete graph K_n has the highest crossing number.",
  "implication_form": "If a graph has chromatic number less than n, then it can be drawn with fewer crossings than the complete graph K_n.",
  "posed_by": "Michael O. Albertson",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 7,
  "explained": "The Albertson conjecture states that for any integer n, the complete graph K_n has the maximum crossing number among all graphs with chromatic number n. In other words, any graph requiring n colors must have a crossing number at least equal to that of K_n. This implies that K_n minimizes the crossing number for graphs with chromatic number n.",
