  "summary": "The Albertson conjecture is an unsubstantiated connection between a graph's chromatic number and crossing number in combinatorial mathematics. It is named after Smith College professor Michael O. Albertson, who made it a hypothesis in 2007;[1] it is one of his many graph coloring theory conjectures.[2] According to the conjecture, the complete graph {\\displaystyle K_{n}} has the shortest crossing number out of all the graphs that require {\\displaystyle n} colors. The conjecture states that a graph may have fewer colors than {\\displaystyle n} if it can be constructed with fewer crossings than {\\displaystyle K_{n}}.",
