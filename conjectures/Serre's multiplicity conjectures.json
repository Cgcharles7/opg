  "summary": "In mathematics, Serre's multiplicity conjectures, named after Jean-Pierre Serre, are certain problems in commutative algebra, motivated by the needs of algebraic geometry. Since Andr√© Weil's initial definition of intersection numbers, around 1949, there had been a question of how to provide a more flexible and computable theory, which Serre sought to address. In 1958, Serre realized that classical algebraic-geometric ideas of multiplicity could be generalized using the concepts of homological al",
