The word partial is used to indicate that not every pair of elements needs to be comparable; that is, there may be pairs for which neither element precedes the other. Partial orders thus generalize total orders, in which every pair is comparable.\nFormally, a partial order is a homogeneous binary relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transi",
