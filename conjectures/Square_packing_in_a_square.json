  "explained": "The Square packing in a square conjecture concerns the problem of packing the maximum number of identical squares (congruent squares) into a larger square without overlapping. The goal is to determine this maximum number for a given ratio of the side length of the small squares to the side length of the large square, or equivalently, to find the packing density. The conjecture refers to the unresolved question of finding the exact maximum number or the optimal packing arrangement for squares of a fixed size into a larger square, particularly for specific ratios where the optimal packing is not known.",
