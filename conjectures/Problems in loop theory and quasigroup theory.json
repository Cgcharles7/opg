  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_problems_in_loop_theory_and_quasigroup_theory",
  "summary": "In mathematics, especially abstract algebra, loop theory and quasigroup theory are active research areas with many open problems.  As in other areas of mathematics, such problems are often made public at professional conferences and meetings. Many of the problems posed here first appeared in the Loops (Prague) conferences and the Mile High (Denver) conferences.",
