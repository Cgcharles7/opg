  "summary": "An Eilenberg–MacLane space is a connected topological space in algebraic topology that has only one nontrivial homotopy group. For a given group \\(G\\) and a positive integer \\(n\\), an Eilenberg–MacLane space of type \\((G,n)\\) is a space whose \\(n\\)-th homotopy group is isomorphic to \\(G\\) and all other homotopy groups are trivial. These spaces are crucial for classifying spaces up to homotopy equivalence, defining cohomology groups, and acting as \"building blocks\" for more complex spaces. ",
