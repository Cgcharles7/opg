  "summary": "A Banach space is a complete normed vector space. This means it is a vector space that has a defined way to measure the \"length\" or \"norm\" of vectors, and it is \"complete\" because every Cauchy sequence of vectors in the space converges to a vector within that same space. This completeness ensures there are no \"holes\" in the space, making it a robust structure for mathematical analysis. ",
