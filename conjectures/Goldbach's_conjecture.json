  "rephrased": "Every even number greater than two can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.",
  "implication_form": "If a number is even and greater than two, then it can be written as the sum of two prime numbers.",
  "posed_by": "Goldbach",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 281,
  "explained": "Goldbach's conjecture states that every even natural number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been verified for all even numbers up to 4 × 10¹⁸ but remains unproven for all larger even numbers.",
