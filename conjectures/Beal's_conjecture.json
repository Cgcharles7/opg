  "summary": "The Beal conjecture is a number theory conjecture that states that in the equation \\(A^{x}+B^{y}=C^{z}\\), if \\(A,B,C,x,y,\\) and \\(z\\) are all positive integers greater than 2, then \\(A,B,\\) and \\(C\\) must share a common prime factor. It was proposed by Andrew Beal in 1993 and is a generalization of Fermat's Last Theorem. The conjecture is currently unsolved, and a $1 million prize is offered for a proof or a counterexample. ",
