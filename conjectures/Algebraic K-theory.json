  "summary": "Algebraic K-theory is a subject area in mathematics with connections to geometry, topology, ring theory, and number theory.  Geometric, algebraic, and arithmetic objects are assigned objects called K-groups.  These are groups in the sense of abstract algebra.  They contain detailed information about the original object but are notoriously difficult to compute; for example, an important outstanding problem is to compute the K-groups of the integers.\nK-theory was discovered in the late 1950s by Al",
