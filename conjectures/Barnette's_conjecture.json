  "summary": "Barnette's conjecture is a statement in graph theory that every cubic, 3-connected, bipartite, planar graph is Hamiltonian. A graph is a network of points (vertices) and lines (edges), and this conjecture proposes that any graph with these specific properties will always contain a Hamiltonian cycle—a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. The conjecture is still unsolved, though it has been verified for a large number of vertices through computational checks. ",
