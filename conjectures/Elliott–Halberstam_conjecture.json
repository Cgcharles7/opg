  "summary": "In number theory, the Elliott–Halberstam conjecture is a conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions. It has many applications in sieve theory. It is named for Peter D. T. A. Elliott and Heini Halberstam, who stated a specific version of the conjecture in 1968.\nOne version of the conjecture is as follows, and stating it requires some notation.
