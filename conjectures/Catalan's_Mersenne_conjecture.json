  "name": "Catalan's Mersenne conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Mersenne_number",
  "rephrased": "Catalan-Mersenne numbers are defined recursively as M₁ = 2, M_{n+1} = 2^{M_n} + 1. The conjecture states that all terms M₁, M₂, ..., M₁₂₇ are prime, but M₁₂₈ is composite.",
  "implication_form": "If a Catalan-Mersenne number is defined as the sequence starting from 2 with each term being 2 raised to the power of the previous term plus 1, then all terms up to the 127th are prime, but the 128th is composite.",
