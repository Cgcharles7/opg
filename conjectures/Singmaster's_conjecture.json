  "explained": "Singmaster's conjecture, proposed by David Singmaster in 1971, addresses the maximum number of times any single number (except 1) appears in Pascal's triangle. Pascal's triangle is constructed by starting with a 1 at the top and adding two adjacent numbers to get the number below them. The conjecture states that despite the infinite repetition of 1 in the triangle, all other numbers occur only a finite number of times. In other words, there exists some fixed integer N such that no number greater than 1 appears more than N times in the entire triangle.",
