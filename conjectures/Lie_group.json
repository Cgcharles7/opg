  "summary": "In mathematics, a Lie group (pronounced  LEE) is a group that is also a differentiable manifold, such that group multiplication and taking inverses are both differentiable.\nA manifold is a space that locally resembles Euclidean space, whereas groups define the abstract concept of a binary operation along with the additional properties it must have to be thought of as a \"transformation\" in the abstract sense, for instance multiplication and the taking of inverses (to allow division), or equivalen",
