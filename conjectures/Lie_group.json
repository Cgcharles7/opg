  "rephrased": "A Lie group is a mathematical structure that combines the properties of a group (a set with an associative operation, identity, and inverses) with those of a geometric surface (a manifold, which looks locally like flat space). This means you can perform smooth, continuous operations like multiplication and inversion on the group elements.",
  "implication_form": "If a mathematical object is a group and also a smooth manifold, then it is a Lie group.",
  "posed_by": "Sophus Lie",
  "solved_by": "Unsolved (as a definition/concept)",
  "year_originated": "1870",
  "explained": "A Lie group is a mathematical structure that combines the algebraic concepts of a group with the geometric concepts of a differentiable manifold. Formally, it is a finite-dimensional real smooth manifold G (a Hausdorff space that is locally Euclidean) equipped with a group structure (a binary operation ·, identity element e, and inversion map ·↦¹⁻¹) such that the multiplication map (g,h)↦g·h: G×G→G and the inversion map g↦g⁻¹: G→G are both smooth (infinitely differentiable) maps. This smooth structure makes Lie groups fundamental objects in the study of continuous symmetries.",
