  "summary": "In mathematics, specifically number theory, a period or algebraic period is a complex number that can be expressed as an integral of an algebraic function over an algebraic domain. The periods are a class of numbers which includes, alongside the algebraic numbers, many well known mathematical constants such as the number Ï€. Sums and products of periods remain periods, such that the periods \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            P\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\math",
