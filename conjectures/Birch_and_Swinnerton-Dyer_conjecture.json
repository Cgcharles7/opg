  "name": "Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The conjecture states that the depth to which an elliptic curve's L-function dips to zero at the central point s=1 determines how many 'directions' exist for finding rational solutions on the curve.",
  "implication_form": "If the L-function of an elliptic curve has a zero of order r at s=1, then the curve has a rank of r (i.e., r independent rational solutions).",
