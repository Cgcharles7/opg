  "summary": "The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture relates the number of rational solutions to an elliptic curve to a property of the curve's L-function at \\(s=1\\). Specifically, it states that the rank of an elliptic curve (the number of independent rational solutions) is equal to the \"order of vanishing\" of its L-function at \\(s=1\\). This is a central problem in number theory and one of the Clay Mathematics Institute's Millennium Prize Problems. ",
  "head": "The L-function \\(L(E,s)\\) has a zero of order \\(r\\) at the central point \\(s=1\\)",
  "tail": "The Mordell-Weil group of rational points \\(E(\\mathbb{Q})\\) has rank \\(r\\).",
