  "summary": "In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, a Hamiltonian decomposition of a given graph is a partition of the edges of the graph into Hamiltonian cycles. Hamiltonian decompositions have been studied both for undirected graphs and for directed graphs. \nIn the undirected case a Hamiltonian decomposition can also be described as a 2-factorization of the graph such that each factor is connected.",
