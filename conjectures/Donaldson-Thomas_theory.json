  "summary": "Donaldson–Thomas theory is a mathematical theory concerning invariants that count sheaves on a type of space called a Calabi–Yau threefold. These invariants are a \"virtual count\" of points in a moduli space and are closely related to string theory and other areas of mathematics. They provide a way to count objects like curves and sheaves in a stable and consistent manner. ",
  "head": "There is a compact moduli space of stable sheaves (or other objects in a Calabi-Yau 3-fold category).",
  "tail": "A virtual number (the Donaldson-Thomas invariant) can be calculated for this space, which provides a count of certain curves or BPS states." ,
