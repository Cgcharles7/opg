  "summary": "In algebraic number theory, a cyclotomic field is a number field obtained by adjoining a complex root of unity to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Q\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} }\n  \n, the field of rational numbers.\nCyclotomic fields played a crucial role in the development of modern algebra and number theory because of their relation with Fermat's Last Theorem. It was in the process of his deep investigations of the arithmetic of these fields (for prime \n  \n    \n      \n",
