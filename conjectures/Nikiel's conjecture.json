  "summary": "In mathematics, Nikiel's conjecture in general topology was a conjectural characterization of the continuous image of a compact total order.  The conjecture was first formulated by Jacek Nikiel in 1986.  The conjecture was proven by Mary Ellen Rudin in 1999.\nThe conjecture states that a compact topological space is the continuous image of a total order if and only if it is a monotonically normal space.\n\n\n== Notes ==",
