  "name": "Honeycomb theorem",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb_theorem",
  "rephrased": "A regular hexagonal grid has the least perimeter for any equal-area division of the plane.",
  "implication_form": "If all regions in a plane subdivision have the same area, then the arrangement with the smallest total perimeter is a regular hexagonal grid.",
  "posed_by": "Janet Morley",
  "solved_by": "Thomas C. Hales",
  "year_originated": 44,
  "explained": "The Honeycomb Theorem states that among all subdivisions of the plane into regions of equal area, the regular hexagonal grid (such as that found in a honeycomb) has the minimal total perimeter. This means that any other subdivision into cells of the same area will have a greater total perimeter length than the hexagonal grid.",
