  "name": "Einstein problem",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_problem",
  "summary": "The term \"Einstein problem\" most commonly refers to either the \"Einstein tile problem,\" a mathematical question about finding a single shape (an \"einstein\") that can tile a plane without creating a repeating pattern, or the \"Einstein's riddle,\" a classic logic puzzle about five houses and their inhabitants' unique characteristics. The former is a genuine mathematical challenge, while the latter is a well-known brain teaser, despite its name being a misattribution. ",
