  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_problem",
  "rephrased": "Prove that there exists a single shape (an 'einstein') that can tile the plane without forming a periodic pattern.",
  "implication_form": "If a shape is an einstein, then it can tile the plane aperiodically.",
  "posed_by": "Albert Einstein",
  "solved_by": "Joshua Shanskii",
  "year_originated": 100,
  "explained": "The Einstein problem refers to the mathematical conjecture (or open problem) of finding a single aperiodic tile, known as an 'einstein', which can tile the plane (i.e., fill the plane without gaps or overlaps) but does so without creating a periodic (repeating) tiling pattern. An einstein tile would be a shape that admits an aperiodic tiling by itself, making it the minimal such tile. This problem remains unsolved; no such single tile has been found yet.",
