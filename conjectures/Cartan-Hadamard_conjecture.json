  "summary": "The Cartan–Hadamard conjecture is a problem in Riemannian geometry that generalizes the isoperimetric inequality to spaces with nonpositive sectional curvature (known as Cartan–Hadamard manifolds). It states that on these manifolds, the inequality should hold with the same Euclidean optimal constant as in Euclidean space, and any set achieving equality must be isometric to a Euclidean ball. The conjecture was proven in all dimensions in 2019 by Joel Spruck and Mohammad Ghomi, building on earlier proofs for specific low dimensions. ",
  "head": "A domain \\(\\Omega \\) with fixed volume exists within an \\(n\\)-dimensional Cartan-Hadamard manifold \\(M\\) (a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature).",
  "tail": "The boundary of \\(\\Omega \\) has the least possible boundary volume (perimeter) if and only if \\(\\Omega \\) is a round \\(n\\)-ball (geodesic ball) that is isometric to a ball of the same volume in Euclidean space (\\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\)). ",
