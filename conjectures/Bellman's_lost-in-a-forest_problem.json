  "summary": "Bellman's lost-in-a-forest problem is an unsolved minimization problem in geometry, originating in 1955 by the American applied mathematician Richard E. Bellman.  The problem is often stated as follows: \"A hiker is lost in a forest whose shape and dimensions are precisely known to him. What is the best path for him to follow to escape from the forest?\" It is usually assumed that the hiker does not know the starting point or direction he is facing. The best path is taken to be the one that minimi",
