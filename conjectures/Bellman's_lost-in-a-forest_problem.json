  "summary": "The Bellman \"lost in a forest\" problem is an unsolved geometric problem about finding the shortest path to guarantee escaping a region of a known shape when your starting position and orientation are unknown. The \"best\" path is the one with the shortest maximum distance in the worst-case scenario, meaning it guarantees escape no matter where you are inside the forest or which way you are facing. Solutions have been found for shapes like circles and squares, but the problem remains difficult for more complex shapes. ",
