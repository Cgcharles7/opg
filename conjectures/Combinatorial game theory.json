  "summary": "Combinatorial game theory is a branch of mathematics and theoretical computer science that typically studies sequential games with perfect information. Research in this field has primarily focused on two-player games in which a position evolves through alternating moves, each governed by well-defined rules, with the aim of achieving a specific winning condition. Unlike economic game theory, combinatorial game theory generally avoids the study of games of chance or games involving imperfect infor",
