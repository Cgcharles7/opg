  "summary": "Chern's conjecture (affine geometry) states that the Euler characteristic of a compact affine manifold must be zero. This unsolved problem, proposed by S.S. Chern in 1955, asserts a fundamental property of certain types of manifolds that have a \"flat\" geometric structure. While the conjecture has been proven for many specific cases, such as complete affine manifolds, it remains unproven in its general form. ",
