  "rephrased": "Vinogradov's Mean-Value Theorem estimates the number of solutions to a system of k equations, each being the sum of s k-th powers, for variables ranging up to X.",
  "implication_form": "If J_{s,k}(X) counts the number of solutions to the system of k equations, each being the sum of s k-th powers, for variables ranging up to X, then J_{s,k}(X) is bounded by X^{k + s(k-1)/k} times some logarithmic factor or power, depending on s and k.",
