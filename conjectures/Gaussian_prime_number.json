  "summary": "In number theory, a Gaussian integer is a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are both integers. The Gaussian integers, with ordinary addition and multiplication of complex numbers, form an integral domain, usually written as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Z\n        \n        [\n        i\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {Z} [i]}\n  \n or \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Z\n        \n        [\n        i\n        ]\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} [i].",
