  "explained": "A Gaussian prime is a Gaussian integer (a complex number of the form a + bi where a and b are integers) that cannot be factored nontrivially within the ring of Gaussian integers Z[i]. This means it is irreducible in Z[i]. A Gaussian integer π is prime (or Gaussian prime) if it is not a unit (units are 1, -1, i, -i) and its only divisors in Z[i] are the unit factors of itself. The norm of a Gaussian integer a + bi, defined as N(a + bi) = a² + b², plays a crucial role: if π is a Gaussian prime, then its norm N(π) is a prime number in the integers or the square of a prime number in the integers (but π itself is not the square of another Gaussian integer). This concept extends the idea of prime numbers to the Gaussian integers, forming part of algebraic number theory.",
