  "name": "Twin prime conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime",
  "rephrased": "There are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by two.",
  "implication_form": "If N is a positive integer, then there exists a pair of twin primes both greater than N.",
  "posed_by": "19th-century mathematicians (attributed to observations by Euclid and formalized by figures like Alphonse de Racine)",
  "solved_by": "Unsolved",
  "year_originated": 223,
  "explained": "A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number, forming a pair (p, p+2) where both p and p+2 are prime. The Twin Prime Conjecture states that there are infinitely many such pairs. In other words, there are infinitely many primes p such that p+2 is also prime. This conjecture is one of the oldest unsolved problems in number theory.",
