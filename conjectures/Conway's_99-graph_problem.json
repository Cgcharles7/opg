  "summary": "Conway's 99-graph problem is an unsolved question in graph theory asking if a graph with 99 vertices exists where every two adjacent vertices share exactly one common neighbor, and every two non-adjacent vertices share exactly two common neighbors. An alternative, more direct phrasing is whether a graph with 99 vertices exists in which every edge is part of a unique triangle, and every non-edge is part of a unique quadrilateral. ",
  "head": "There exists an undirected graph \\(G\\) with 99 vertices such that: Every pair of adjacent vertices has exactly one common neighbor. Every pair of non-adjacent vertices has exactly two common neighbors. ", 
  "tail": "Q: This graph cannot have a vertex-transitive group of automorphisms (i.e., a high degree of symmetry where every vertex looks the same as every other vertex in terms of its position in the graph's structure). ",
