  "name": "Conway's 99-graph problem",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_99-graph_problem",
  "rephrased": "A graph with 99 vertices exists where: adjacent vertices share exactly one common neighbor, and non-adjacent vertices share exactly two common neighbors.",
  "implication_form": "If a graph with 99 vertices exists where every pair of adjacent vertices has exactly one common neighbor, then every pair of non-adjacent vertices has exactly two common neighbors.",
  "posed_by": "John Horton Conway",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": "ca. 1980s",
  "explained": "Conway's 99-graph problem is an unsolved existence question in graph theory. It asks whether there exists a graph with precisely 99 vertices satisfying two conditions: 1) For any two vertices that are adjacent (connected by an edge), they have exactly one common neighbor vertex. 2) For any two vertices that are not adjacent, they have exactly two common neighbor vertices.",
