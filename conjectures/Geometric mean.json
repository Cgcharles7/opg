  "summary": "In mathematics, the geometric mean (also known as the mean proportional) is a mean or average which indicates a central tendency of a finite collection of positive real numbers by using the product of their values (as opposed to the arithmetic mean, which uses their sum).  The geometric mean of ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n⁠ numbers is the nth root of their product, i.e., for a collection of numbers a1, a2, ..., an, the geometric mean is defined as\n\n  \n    \n   ",
