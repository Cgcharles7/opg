  "summary": "In mathematics, specifically in number theory, Newman's conjecture is a conjecture about the behavior of the partition function modulo any integer.  Specifically, it states that for any integers m and r such that \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n        ≤\n        r\n        ≤\n        m\n        −\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0\\leq r\\leq m-1}\n  \n, the value of the partition function \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(n)}\n  \n satisfies the c",
