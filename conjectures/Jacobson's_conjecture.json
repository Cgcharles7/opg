  "name": "Jacobson's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "In a Noetherian ring, the intersection of all powers of its Jacobson radical is the zero ring (the trivial ring).",
  "implication_form": "It is not possible to rewrite the conjecture in the form \"If P, then Q\" because no formal statement was provided.",
  "posed_by": "Nathan Jacobson",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 83,
  "explained": "Jacobson's conjecture states that for a two-sided Noetherian ring R, the intersection of all powers of its Jacobson radical (the set of all quasi-regular elements, denoted J(R)) is the zero ideal. In other words, ∩_{n=1}^∞ J(R)^n = (0). This means that every element in the intersection must be nilpotent (i.e., some positive integer power of it is zero). The conjecture relies critically on the ring being two-sided Noetherian (both left and right Noetherian).",
