  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%E2%80%93P%C3%B3lya_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function are eigenvalues of a specific self-adjoint operator.",

  "posed_by": "David Hilbert and George Pólya",

  "explained": "The Hilbert–Pólya conjecture proposes that the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function correspond to the eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator, which would prove the Riemann Hypothesis. This means the imaginary parts of the zeros would all be real numbers, as self-adjoint operators have real eigenvalues. The conjecture remains unproven, and the core challenge is to find a specific operator that satisfies this property. ",
