  "summary": "In mathematics, an affine space is a geometric structure that generalizes some of the properties of Euclidean spaces in such a way that these are independent of the concepts of distance and measure of angles, keeping only the properties related to parallelism and ratio of lengths for parallel line segments. Affine space is the setting for affine geometry. \nAs in Euclidean space, the fundamental objects in an affine space are called points, which can be thought of as locations in the space withou",
