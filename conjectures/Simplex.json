The simplex is so-named because it represents the simplest possible polytope in any given dimension. For example,\n\na 0-dimensional simplex is a point,\na 1-dimensional simplex is a line segment,\na 2-dimensional simplex is a triangle,\na 3-dimensional simplex is a tetrahedron, and\na 4-dimensional simplex is a 5-cell.\nSpecifically, a k-simplex is a k-dimensi",
