  "name": "Bombieri–Lang conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombieri%E2%80%93Lang_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Faltings's theorem proves that curves of general type have finitely many rational points. The Bombieri–Lang conjecture extends this to higher-dimensional varieties, stating that any positive-dimensional projective variety of general type defined over a number field should have rational points that are not Zariski-dense (i.e., they lie on a proper subvariety).",
  "implication_form": "If X is a positive-dimensional projective variety defined over a number field K and X is of general type, then the set of K-rational points on X is not Zariski-dense.",
