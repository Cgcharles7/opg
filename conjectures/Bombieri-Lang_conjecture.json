  "summary": "The Bombieri–Lang conjecture is a fundamental conjecture in algebraic geometry that states that for a \"variety of general type\" (a high-dimensional generalization of curves with genus \\(g\\ge 2\\)), the set of rational points is not \"Zariski-dense\". Instead, the rational points are contained in a proper closed subset, which means there are a finite number of rational points or they lie on a smaller subvariety. The conjecture is a generalization of Faltings's theorem, which proved the same result for curves.",
