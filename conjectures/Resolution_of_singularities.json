  "name": "Resolution of singularities",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_of_singularities",
  "rephrased": "Any algebraic variety with singularities can be transformed into a smooth variety via a specific type of map called a proper birational map.",
  "implication_form": "If an algebraic variety has singularities, then there exists a non-singular variety and a proper birational map from it to the original variety.",
  "posed_by": "Hironaka resolved the characteristic zero case, but the core idea originates from earlier work in algebraic geometry.",
  "solved_by": "Hironaka for varieties over fields of characteristic zero; unsolved for varieties of dimension at least 4 over fields of characteristic p.",
  "year_originated": 70,
  "explained": "The resolution of singularities problem addresses whether every algebraic variety V (over a field, typically assumed algebraically closed) has a resolution. A resolution is a proper birational morphism π: W → V, where W is a non-singular (smooth) variety, and birational means that π restricts to an isomorphism between dense open subsets of W and V. Hironaka's theorem proves this is possible for varieties over fields of characteristic zero, but the question remains open for varieties of dimension at least 4 over fields of positive characteristic.",
