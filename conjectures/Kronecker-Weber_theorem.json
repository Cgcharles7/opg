  "explained": "The Kronecker–Weber theorem (often referred to as a foundational result rather than a conjecture in its final form) states that every finite abelian extension of the rational numbers Q is contained within some cycloticlean field. In other words, if K/Q is a finite Galois extension with abelian Galois group Gal(K/Q), then K is contained in a cyclotomic field Q(ζ_n) for some integer n, where ζ_n is a primitive n-th root of unity.",
