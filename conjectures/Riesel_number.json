  "rephrased": "An odd natural number k is a Riesel number if all numbers of the form k multiplied by 2 raised to any natural number n and then subtracted 1 are composite.",
  "implication_form": "It is challenging to express this as a simple 'If P, then Q' implication, as it primarily defines a property (being a Riesel number) based on a condition (all k*2^n -1 being composite). However, one could say: If k is an odd natural number and for all natural numbers n, k*2^n -1 is composite, then k is a Riesel number.",

  "explained": "A Riesel number is an odd natural number k such that the expression k × 2^n - 1 is composite for every natural number n.",
