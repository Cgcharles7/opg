  "summary": "In mathematics, Weibel's conjecture gives a criterion for vanishing of negative algebraic K-theory groups. The conjecture was proposed by Weibel (1980) and proven in full generality by Kerz, Strunk & Tamme (2018) using methods from derived algebraic geometry. Previously partial cases had been proven by \nHaesemeyer (2004), \nCorti√±as et al. (2008), \nGeisser & Hesselholt (2010), \nCisinski (2013), \nKelly (2014), and\nMorrow (2016).",
