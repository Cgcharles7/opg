  "rephrased": "A Danzer set is a discrete collection of points such that every convex shape with a volume of one must contain at least one point from the set.",
  "implication_form": "It is not straightforward to express this conjecture in the form 'If P, then Q' because the original statement defines the Danzer set property, and the core question is about the existence of a set satisfying this property.",
  "posed_by": "Ludwig Danzer",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 1970,
  "explained": "A Danzer set is a set of points in n-dimensional Euclidean space such that every convex body with a volume of one intersects the set. This means that for any convex region (e.g., a hypercube, simplex, or ellipsoid) that has a volume of one, there is at least one point from the Danzer set lying within it. The trivial example is the entire space. The central open question posed by Ludwig Danzer is whether there exists a discrete Danzer set, i.e., a set with only a finite number of points in any bounded region (finite density), that satisfies this intersection property.",
