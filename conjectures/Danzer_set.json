  "summary": "A Danzer set is a set of points in n-dimensional space that intersects every convex body with a volume of one. The existence of discrete Danzer sets with finite density is an open question in mathematics, posed by the geometer Ludwig Danzer. The whole space is a Danzer set, but Danzer asked if a discrete set (one with only a finite number of points in any bounded area) could also be a Danzer set. ",
