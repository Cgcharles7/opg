  "summary": "In mathematics, Thurston's geometrization conjecture (now a theorem) states that each of certain three-dimensional topological spaces has a unique geometric structure that can be associated with it. It is an analogue of the uniformization theorem for two-dimensional surfaces, which states that every simply connected Riemann surface can be given one of three geometries (Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic).\nIn three dimensions, it is not always possible to assign a single geometry to a whole topo",
