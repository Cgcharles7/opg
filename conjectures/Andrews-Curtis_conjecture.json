  "name": "Andrews–Curtis conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrews%E2%80%93Curtis_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The Andrews–Curtis conjecture states that any way of writing the 'empty product' (trivial group) using an equal number of starting symbols (generators) and equations (relations) can be transformed into a presentation showing no relations by applying a series of specific operations (Nielsen transformations on generators and relations, plus conjugating relations).",
  "implication_form": "If a balanced presentation represents the trivial group, then it can be transformed into a trivial presentation (one with no relations) using a series of Nielsen transformations and conjugations.",
  "posed_by": "James J. Andrews and Morton L. Curtis",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 59,
  "explained": "The Andrews–Curtis conjecture states that any balanced presentation (i.e., a presentation with the same number of generators and relations) of the trivial group (the group with a single identity element) is an 'Andrews–Curtis trivial presentation'. This means it can be transformed into the presentation with no generators and no relations (the trivial presentation) by a series of operations known as Nielsen transformations applied to the generators and relators, and by conjugating the relators.",
