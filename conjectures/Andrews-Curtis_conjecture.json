  "summary": "The Andrews–Curtis conjecture, named for James J. Andrews and Morton L. Curtis who proposed it in 1965, asserts that any balanced presentation (i.e., a presentation with the same number of generators and relations) of the trivial group can be converted into a trivial presentation by a series of Nielsen transformations on the relators along with conjugations of relators. It is challenging to confirm whether or not the conjecture is true for a particular balanced presentation.",
