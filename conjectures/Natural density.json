  "summary": "In number theory, natural density, also referred to as asymptotic density or arithmetic density, is a measure of how \"large\" a subset of the set of natural numbers is. It relies chiefly on the probability of encountering members of the desired subset when combing through the interval [1, n] as n grows large.\nFor example, it may seem intuitively that there are more positive integers than perfect squares, because every perfect square is already positive and yet many other positive integers exist b",
