  "summary": "In geometry and combinatorics, a simplicial (or combinatorial) d-sphere is a simplicial complex homeomorphic to the d-dimensional sphere. Some simplicial spheres arise as the boundaries of convex polytopes, however, in higher dimensions most simplicial spheres cannot be obtained in this way.\nOne important open problem in the field was the g-conjecture, formulated by Peter McMullen, which asks about possible numbers of faces of different dimensions of a simplicial sphere. In December 2018, the g-",
