  "summary": "In combinatorial mathematics, the Albertson conjecture is an unproven relationship between the crossing number and the chromatic number of a graph. It is named after Michael O. Albertson, a professor at Smith College, who stated it as a conjecture in 2007; it is one of his many conjectures in graph coloring theory. The conjecture states that, among all graphs requiring \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n colors, the complete graph \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n",
