  "summary": "Kato's conjecture is a mathematical problem named after mathematician Tosio Kato, of the University of California, Berkeley. Kato initially posed the problem in 1953.\nKato asked whether the square roots of certain elliptic operators, defined via functional calculus, are analytic. The full statement of the conjecture as given by Auscher et al. is: \"the domain of the square root of a uniformly complex elliptic operator \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n        =\n        âˆ’\n        \n          d\n          i\n",
