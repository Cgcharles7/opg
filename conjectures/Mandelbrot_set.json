  "rephrased": "The Mandelbrot set consists of all complex numbers 'c' for which the sequence defined by 'z₀ = 0' and 'z_{n+1} = z_n² + c' does not diverge to infinity.",
  "implication_form": "If the sequence defined by iterating the function f(z) = z² + c starting from 0 remains bounded, then the complex number c belongs to the Mandelbrot set.",
  "posed_by": "Benoît Mandelbrot",

  "year_originated": 40,
  "explained": "The Mandelbrot set is a mathematical set of complex numbers c for which the function f_c(z) = z² + c, when iterated starting from z = 0, does not diverge to infinity. A complex number c is in the Mandelbrot set if the sequence defined by z_0 = 0, z_{n+1} = z_n² + c remains bounded (does not escape to infinity) for all n. It is defined in the complex plane and is one of the most famous examples of a fractal, characterized by an infinitely repeating, jagged boundary.",
