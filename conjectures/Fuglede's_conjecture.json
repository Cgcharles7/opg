  "rephrased": "Every measurable set in R^d with positive finite Lebesgue measure is a spectral set (meaning its characteristic function is a basis for the space of square-integrable functions) if and only if it tiles R^d by integer translations.",
  "implication_form": "If a set tiles R^d by integer translations, then it is a spectral set.",

  "explained": "Fuglede's conjecture, proposed by Bent Fuglede in 1974, is a fundamental open problem in harmonic analysis. It posits that a bounded measurable subset \\( \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d \\) with positive Lebesgue measure is a **spectral set** (meaning its characteristic function can be expanded in an orthogonal basis consisting of complex exponentials) if and only if it is a **tiling set** (meaning it can be translated periodically to tile the entire \\( \\mathbb{R}^ (d \\) without overlap or gaps). In other words, \\( \\Omega \\) is spectral if and only if it tiles \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\) by translations.",
