  "summary": "In vector calculus, the Jacobian matrix (, ) of a vector-valued function of several variables is the matrix of all its first-order partial derivatives. If this matrix is square, that is, if the number of variables equals the number of components of function values, then its determinant is called the Jacobian determinant. Both the matrix and (if applicable) the determinant are often referred to simply as the Jacobian. They are named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.\nThe Jacobian matrix is the natur",
