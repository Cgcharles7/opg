  "summary": "The Connes Embedding Problem (CEP) is a fundamental question in mathematics that asked if every tracial von Neumann algebra could be approximated by finite-dimensional matrix algebras. In simpler terms, it questioned if complex, infinite-dimensional systems could be faithfully represented by simpler, finite systems. While it remained a central open problem for decades, the problem was proven to have a negative solution as a corollary of a 2020 result in quantum complexity theory called MIP*=RE. ",
  "head": "The Connes Embedding Problem has a positive answer (i.e., all tracial von Neumann algebras can be approximated by finite-dimensional matrices).", 
  "tall": "A certain related decision problem in logic is decidable, or a certain set of quantum correlations is equal to another set of correlations (Tsirelson's problem) or the Halting Problem would be decidable. ",
