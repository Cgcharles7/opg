  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connes_embedding_problem",
  "rephrased": "Can complex infinite-dimensional systems (tracial von Neumann algebras) be faithfully mimicked by simpler finite systems (finite-dimensional matrices)?",
  "implication_form": "If a tracial von Neumann algebra exists, then it can be approximated by finite-dimensional matrices.",
  "posed_by": "Alain Connes",
  "solved_by": "The Connes Embedding Problem was shown to have a negative solution (i.e., not all tracial von Neumann algebras can be approximated by finite-dimensional matrices) as a corollary of the MIP*=RE result in 2020.",
  "year_originated": 25,
  "explained": "The Connes Embedding Problem (CEP) is a fundamental question in operator algebras. It asks whether every tracial von Neumann algebra can be approximated in the sense of being embeddable or approximable by finite-dimensional matrix algebras (or their ultraproducts). In simpler terms, it questioned if the complex structure of infinite-dimensional tracial von Neumann algebras could be faithfully captured by simpler, finite-dimensional systems. This conjecture remained open for decades until it was resolved negatively in 2020 as a consequence of the groundbreaking result that MIP* = RE.",
