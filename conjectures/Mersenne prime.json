  "summary": "In mathematics, a Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two.  That is, it is a prime number of the form Mn = 2n − 1 for some integer n.  They are named after Marin Mersenne, a French Minim friar, who studied them in the early 17th century.  If n is a composite number then so is 2n − 1.  Therefore, an equivalent definition of the Mersenne primes is that they are the prime numbers of the form Mp = 2p − 1 for some prime p.\nThe exponents n which give Mersenne primes are 2",
