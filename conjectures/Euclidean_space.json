  "summary": "Euclidean space is a flat, geometric space that follows the axioms of Euclidean geometry, where the \"flatness\" means parallel lines never meet and the angles of a triangle always sum to 180 degrees. It can exist in any number of dimensions, denoted as \\(R^{n}\\), where n is the dimension. For example, \\(R^{1}\\) is a line, \\(R^{2}\\) is a plane, and \\(R^{3}\\) is the three-dimensional space we experience.",
