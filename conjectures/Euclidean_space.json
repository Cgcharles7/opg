  "explained": "Euclidean space is defined as a geometric space characterized by the axioms of Euclidean geometry. Key properties include: 1) The parallel postulate (parallel lines never meet), 2) The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, and 3) The existence of a consistent notion of distance and angle. It exists in any number of dimensions, denoted as \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) for dimension n, where \\( \\mathbb{R}^1 \\) is a line, \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) is a plane, and \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\) is the standard three-dimensional space.",
