  "summary": "In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the line graph of an undirected graph G is another graph  L(G) that represents the adjacencies between edges of G.  L(G) is constructed in the following way: for each edge in G, make a vertex in  L(G); for every two edges in G that have a vertex in common, make an edge between their corresponding vertices in  L(G).\nThe name line graph comes from a paper by Harary & Norman (1960) although both Whitney (1932) and Krausz (1943) used the construction b",
