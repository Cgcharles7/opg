  "explained": "The Vlasov–Maxwell equations constitute a system of coupled partial differential equations that describe the evolution of a collisionless plasma. The system consists of the Vlasov equation for the distribution function f(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{v}, t) (or phase space density) of particles (ions and electrons) in phase space (position \\mathbf{x} and velocity \\mathbf{v}), coupled with Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field \\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{x}, t) and \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x}, t). The equations are:\\n\\n1.  **Vlasov Equation:** Describes the time evolution of the distribution function f due to the Lorentz force (or other relevant force, e.g., electric and magnetic fields derived from Maxwell's equations).\\n\\n\\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} f + \\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{v}} f = 0\\)\\n\\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\\) is the force on a particle with charge q and mass m, moving in the electromagnetic field.\\n\\n2.  **Maxwell's Equations:** Govern the evolution of the electromagnetic field, with sources given by the plasma current density and charge density derived from f.\\n\\n\\(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho / \\epsilon_0\\)\\n\\(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\partial_t \\mathbf{B}\\)\\n\\(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0\\)\\n\\(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\partial_t \\mathbf{E}\\)\\n\\nwhere the charge density \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\int f \\, d\\mathbf{v}\\) and current density \\(\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\int \\mathbf{v} f \\, d\\mathbf{v}\\) are obtained by integrating the Vlasov equation over velocity space.\\n\\nThese equations are used to model a wide range of plasma phenomena, from space plasma physics to fusion research, assuming negligible collisions.",
