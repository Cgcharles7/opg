  "summary": "In mathematics, more specifically ring theory, the Jacobson radical of a ring \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  \n is the ideal consisting of those elements in \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  \n that annihilate all simple right \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  \n-modules. It happens that substituting \"left\" in place of \"right\" in the definition yields the same ideal, and so the notion is leftâ€“right symmetric. The",
