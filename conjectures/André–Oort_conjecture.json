  "summary": "A non-abelian counterpart of the Manin–Mumford conjecture, which is currently a theorem (proved in multiple ways), is the André–Oort conjecture, a mathematical problem in Diophantine geometry, a subfield of number theory. A description of the Zariski closure of sets of special points in Shimura varieties is the subject of the conjecture. Frans Oort conjectured a more general statement (although with a restriction on the kind of Shimura variety) in 1995, while Yves André articulated a special example of the conjecture in 1989[1].[2] These two conjectures naturally lead to the current version.",
