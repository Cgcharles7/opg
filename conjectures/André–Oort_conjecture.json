  "summary": "In mathematics, the André–Oort conjecture is a problem in Diophantine geometry, a branch of number theory, that can be seen as a non-abelian analogue of the Manin–Mumford conjecture, which is now a theorem (proven in several different ways).  \nThe conjecture concerns itself with a characterization of the Zariski closure of sets of special points in Shimura varieties.\nA special case of the conjecture was stated by Yves André in 1989 and a more general statement (albeit with a restriction on the t",
