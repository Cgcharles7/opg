  "name": "Skewes's number",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewes%27s_number",
  "rephrased": "Skewes's number is defined as the smallest natural number x where the count of prime numbers less than or equal to x (denoted π(x)) is greater than the logarithmic integral of x (li(x)).",
  "implication_form": "If x is the smallest natural number such that π(x) > li(x), then x is Skewes's number.",
  "posed_by": "Stanley Skewes",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 87,
  "explained": "Skewes's number is not strictly a conjecture but the name given to a very large number that serves as an upper bound for the smallest natural number x where the prime-counting function π(x) (which counts the number of primes less than or equal to x) first exceeds the logarithmic integral function li(x). The conjecture aspect lies in the fact that there exists such a smallest x where this crossover occurs, and the task is to find it. The number Skewes originally proposed was an upper bound for this x, based on certain assumptions (like the Riemann Hypothesis).",
