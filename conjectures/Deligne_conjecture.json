  "name": "Deligne conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Deligne",
  "summary": "Deligne's conjecture is a central idea in mathematics that has two main forms: one relating the special values of L-functions to the determinant of period matrices for motives, and another that states the Hochschild cochain complex of an associative algebra has the structure of an algebra over the little disks operad. While originally a conjecture, both forms have been proven and are considered theorems. ",
  "head": "An L-function of a motive is \"critical\" and evaluated at a special integer value.", 
  "tail": "\\(Q\\): This special value is equal, up to a rational multiple, to the determinant of a specific period matrix (which relates de Rham and Betti cohomology).",
