  "summary": "In mathematics, the Hilbert–Smith conjecture is concerned with the transformation groups of manifolds; and in particular with the limitations on topological groups G that can act effectively (faithfully) on a (topological) manifold M. Restricting to groups G which are locally compact and have a continuous, faithful group action on M, the conjecture states that G must be a Lie group.\nBecause of known structural results on G, it is enough to deal with the case where G is the additive group \n  \n   ",
