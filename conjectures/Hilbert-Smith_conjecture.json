  "name": "Hilbert–Smith conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%E2%80%93Smith_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "A locally compact topological group that acts faithfully on a (topological) manifold must be a Lie group.",
  "implication_form": "If a locally compact group acts faithfully on a manifold, then it is a Lie group.",
  "posed_by": "David Hilbert and John Edward Smith",
  "solved_by": "Robert Sternberg (with contributions from others like Andrew Casson, John Frank Adams, and others, though proof verification details are complex)",
  "year_originated": 80,
  "explained": "The Hilbert–Smith conjecture states that if a locally compact group G acts faithfully and continuously on a topological manifold M, then G must be a Lie group. In other words, any group that acts effectively on a manifold must possess a smooth manifold structure compatible with its group operations. This conjecture connects the topological properties of group actions on manifolds to their underlying smooth structure.",
