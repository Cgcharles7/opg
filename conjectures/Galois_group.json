  "explained": "A Galois group is the group of automorphisms of a Galois extension, which is a field extension that is both normal and separable. It is the set of all field automorphisms that fix the base field element-wise and map the extension field to itself. The fundamental theorem of Galois theory establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of the Galois group and the intermediate fields of the extension. This group captures the symmetry of the roots of a polynomial defining the extension.",
