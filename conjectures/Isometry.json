  "summary": "In mathematics, an isometry (or congruence, or congruent transformation) is a distance-preserving transformation between metric spaces, usually assumed to be bijective. The word isometry is derived from the Ancient Greek: ἴσος isos meaning \"equal\", and μέτρον metron meaning \"measure\". If the transformation is from a metric space to itself, it is a kind of geometric transformation known as a motion.",
