  "summary": "Linnik's theorem in analytic number theory answers a natural question after Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. It asserts that there exist positive c and L such that, if we denote p(a,d) the least prime in the arithmetic progression\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        +\n        n\n        d\n        ,\n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a+nd,\\ }\n  \n\nwhere n runs through the positive integers and a and d are any given positive coprime integers with 1 ≤ a ≤ d − 1, then:\n\n  \n    \n    ",
