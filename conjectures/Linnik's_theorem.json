  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnik%27s_theorem",
  "rephrased": "There are universal constants c and L such that for any arithmetic progression defined by a + n*d (where n is a positive integer), with a and d coprime integers and 1 ≤ a < d, the smallest prime in this progression is at most d^L * (log(d))^c.",
  "implication_form": "If a and d are coprime positive integers with 1 ≤ a ≤ d-1, then there exists a prime p such that p = a + n*d for some positive integer n and p ≤ d^L * (log(d))^c.",

  "explained": "Linnik's theorem states that there exist positive constants c and L such that for any coprime positive integers a and d with 1 ≤ a ≤ d - 1, the arithmetic progression a + nd (where n runs through the positive integers) contains a prime p satisfying p ≤ c * d^L. This theorem provides a quantitative bound on the smallest prime in such an arithmetic progression, complementing Dirichlet's theorem which guarantees infinitely many primes but does not specify their size.",
