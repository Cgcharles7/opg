  "summary": "In mathematics, a dijoin is a subset of the edges of a directed graph, with the property that contracting every edge in the dijoin produces a strongly connected graph. Equivalently, a dijoin is a subset of the edges that, for every dicut, includes at least one edge crossing the dicut. Here, a dicut is a partition of the vertices into two subsets, so that each edge that has an endpoint in both subsets is directed from the first subset to the second.\n\nWoodall's conjecture, an unsolved problem in t",
