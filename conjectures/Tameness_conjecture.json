  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tameness_theorem",
  "rephrased": "A complete hyperbolic 3-manifold with a finitely generated fundamental group can be made compact by adding a boundary (it is topologically tame).",
  "implication_form": "If a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold has a finitely generated fundamental group, then it is topologically tame (i.e., homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3-manifold).",
