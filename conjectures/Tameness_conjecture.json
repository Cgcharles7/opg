  "name": "Tameness conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tameness_theorem",
  "rephrased": "A complete hyperbolic 3-manifold with a finitely generated fundamental group can be made compact by adding a boundary (it is topologically tame).",
  "implication_form": "If a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold has a finitely generated fundamental group, then it is topologically tame (i.e., homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3-manifold).",
  "posed_by": "Albert Marden",
  "solved_by": "Ian Agol and Danny Calegari (and David Gabai)",
  "year_originated": 38,
  "explained": "The Tameness Conjecture, also known as Marden's Tameness Conjecture, states that any complete hyperbolic 3-manifold with a finitely generated fundamental group is \"tame,\" meaning it is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3-manifold. This conjecture was proven by 2004 mathematician Ian Agol and, independently, by Danny Calegari and David Gabai. The theorem is now known as the Tameness Theorem. ",
