  "summary": "In mathematics, a Hilbert space is a real or complex inner product space that is also a complete metric space with respect to the metric induced by the inner product. It generalizes the notion of Euclidean space, to infinite dimensions. The inner product, which is the analog of the dot product from vector calculus, allows lengths and angles to be defined. Furthermore, completeness means that there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used. A Hilbert space is a",
