  "summary": "In mathematics, a derivation is a function on an algebra that generalizes certain features of the derivative operator.  Specifically, given an algebra A over a ring or a field K, a K-derivation is a K-linear map D : A â†’ A that satisfies Leibniz's law:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n        (\n        a\n        b\n        )\n        =\n        a\n        D\n        (\n        b\n        )\n        +\n        D\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        b\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D(ab)=aD(b)+D(a)b.}\n ",
