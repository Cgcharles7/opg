  "name": "Determinantal conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinantal_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The determinant of the sum of two n by n normal complex matrices is itself a combination of the eigenvalues from each matrix, specifically one from A and one from B, arranged in every possible order, and this value must lie within the set of all such possible combinations.",
  "implication_form": "If A and B are two n×n normal complex matrices, then the determinant of their sum is contained within the convex hull formed by all products of eigenvalues from A and B taken in every possible permutation.",
  "posed_by": "Ralph Philip Boas, Jr., Marvin Marcus, and Henryk Michałek (originally stated by Boas; named after Marcus and de Oliveira)",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": "50",
  "explained": "The Determinantal conjecture (Marcus-de Oliveira conjecture) states that for two normal complex matrices A and B of size n×n, with eigenvalues σ(A) = {a₁, …, aₙ} and σ(B) = {b₁, …, bₙ}, the determinant of their sum, det(A+B), lies in the convex hull of the set of points {∏_{k=1}^{n} (a_{σ(k)} b_{τ(k)}) for all permutations σ, τ of {1,2,…,n}. This conjecture concerns the determinant of the sum of two normal matrices and its relation to the eigenvalues.",
