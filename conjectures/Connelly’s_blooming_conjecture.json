  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blooming_(geometry)",
  "summary": "An early work on blooming by Biedl, Lubiw, and Sun from 1999 showed that some nets for non-convex but topologically spherical polyhedra have no blooming. The question of whether every convex polyhedron admits a net with a blooming was posed by Robert Connelly, and came to be known as Connelly's blooming conjecture.",
  "head":  "A given shape is a net (a surface cut along edges and laid flat without overlap) of a convex polyhedron.", 
  "tail":  "The net has a blooming (a continuous, non-self-intersecting three-dimensional motion that transforms it from the flat state in a plane back into the original polyhedron). ",
