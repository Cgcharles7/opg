  "summary": "In the mathematical area of graph theory, a conference graph is a strongly regular graph with parameters v, k = (v − 1)/2, λ = (v − 5)/4, and μ = (v − 1)/4.  It is the graph associated with a symmetric conference matrix, and consequently its order v must be 1 (modulo 4) and a sum of two squares.\nConference graphs are known to exist for all small values of v allowed by the restrictions, e.g., v = 5, 9, 13, 17, 25, 29, and (the Paley graphs) for all prime powers congruent to 1 (modulo 4).
