  "summary": "In number theory, the generalized taxicab number Taxicab(k, j, n) is the smallest number — if it exists — that can be expressed as the sum of j numbers to the kth positive power in n different ways. For k = 3 and j = 2, they coincide with the taxicab number.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  T\n                  a\n                  x\n                  i\n                  c\n                  a\n                  b\n                \n   ",
