  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yau%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Any closed three-dimensional shape with a specific geometric structure (a Riemannian metric) must contain infinitely many surfaces that are locally minimal, like soap films without gravity.",
  "implication_form": "If a Riemannian 3-manifold is closed, then it has infinitely many minimal surfaces.",

  "year_originated": 1982,
  "explained": "Yau's conjecture states that any closed Riemannian 3-manifold admits infinitely many distinct smooth closed immersed minimal surfaces.",
