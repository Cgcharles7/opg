  "summary": "In number theory, Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n that are relatively prime to \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n. It is written using the Greek letter phi as \n  \n    \n      \n        φ\n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi (n)}\n  \n or \n  \n    \n      \n        ϕ\n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi (n)}\n",
