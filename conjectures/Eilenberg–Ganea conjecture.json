  "summary": "The Eilenberg–Ganea conjecture is a claim in algebraic topology.  It was formulated by Samuel Eilenberg and Tudor Ganea in 1957, in a short, but influential paper.  It states that if a group G has cohomological dimension 2, then it has a 2-dimensional Eilenberg–MacLane space \n  \n    \n      \n        K\n        (\n        G\n        ,\n        1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K(G,1)}\n  \n.  For n different from 2, a group G of cohomological dimension n has an n-dimensional Eilenberg–MacLane s",
