  "explained": "The Siegel zero conjecture (or the non-existence of Siegel zeros) addresses potential counterexamples to the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for Dirichlet L-functions associated with real primitive characters. Specifically, it states that for a Dirichlet L-function L(s, χ) attached to a real primitive character χ modulo q, there is no zero in the complex plane located in the interval (1 - ε(q), 1) for any fixed ε(q) > 0 that depends only on q. A Siegel zero would be a zero very close to s=1, but not necessarily at s=1 itself. The conjecture asserts that no such zero exists for any real primitive character χ.",
