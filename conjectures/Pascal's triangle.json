  "summary": "In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is an infinite triangular array of the binomial coefficients which play a crucial role in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra. In much of the Western world, it is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although other mathematicians studied it centuries before him in Persia, India, China, Germany, and Italy.\nThe rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        =\n        0\n      \n  ",
