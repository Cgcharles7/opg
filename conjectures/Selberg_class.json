  "name": "Selberg class",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selberg_class",
  "rephrased": "The Selberg class defines a set of Dirichlet series (complex functions) that satisfy four specific axioms (degree, Ramanujan-Paterson conjecture, self-duality, and Euler product). The goal is to classify all such functions.",
  "implication_form": "If a Dirichlet series satisfies the four axioms of the Selberg class, then it belongs to this class and can be classified based on its properties.",
  "posed_by": "Atle Selberg",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 1970,
  "explained": "The Selberg class is an axiomatic framework defining a set of Dirichlet series L-functions. An L-function is a member of this class if it satisfies four axioms: (1) It is given by a Dirichlet series with absolutely convergent right half-plane, (2) It satisfies a Ramanujan Conjecture bound on the growth of its coefficients, (3) It is self-dual (its L-function is essentially its own functional equation partner), and (4) It possesses analytic continuation and a functional equation relating its values at s and 1-s. The Selberg class includes the Riemann zeta function and Dirichlet L-functions, and is conjectured to consist entirely of L-functions associated with automorphic representations.",
