  "summary": "In mathematics, canonical singularities are a class of singularities that appear on the canonical model of an algebraic variety, and terminal singularities are a narrower class that occur as singularities of minimal models. These classes of singularities were introduced by Miles Reid (1980). Terminal singularities are important in the minimal model program because smooth minimal models do not exist in the desired generality, and hence certain \"mild\" singularities must be allowed.",
