  "name": "Abelian extension",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_extension",
  "rephrased": "An abelian extension is a type of field extension that is Galois (meaning it is a normal and separable extension) and has an abelian group of symmetries (the Galois group).",
  "implication_form": "If a field extension is Galois and its Galois group is abelian, then it is an abelian extension.",
  "posed_by": "unknown",

  "year_originated": 200,
  "explained": "An abelian extension is a Galois extension where the Galois group is abelian. A cyclic extension is a specific type of abelian extension where the Galois group is cyclic. Solvable extensions are Galois extensions with a solvable Galois group, which includes all abelian extensions (since abelian groups are solvable) but is a broader category.",
