  "summary": "An abelian extension in abstract algebra is a Galois extension with an abelian Galois group. The extension is also known as a cyclic extension when the Galois group is cyclic as well. Conversely, if a Galois extension's Galois group is solvable—that is, if the group can be broken down into a number of normal extensions of an abelian group—it is said to be solvable. A cyclic extension is any finite extension of a finite field.",
