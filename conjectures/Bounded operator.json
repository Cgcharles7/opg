  "summary": "In functional analysis and operator theory, a bounded linear operator is a special kind of linear transformation that is particularly important in infinite dimensions. In finite dimensions, a linear transformation takes a bounded set to another bounded set (for example, a rectangle in the plane goes either to a parallelogram or bounded line segment when a linear transformation is applied). However, in infinite dimensions, linearity is not enough to ensure that bounded sets remain bounded: a boun",
