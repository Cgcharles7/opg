  "summary": "In number theory, the Bateman–Horn conjecture is a statement concerning the frequency of prime numbers among the values of a system of polynomials, named after mathematicians Paul T. Bateman and Roger A. Horn who proposed it in 1962. It provides a vast generalization of such conjectures as the Hardy–Littlewood conjecture on the density of twin primes or their conjecture on primes of the form \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n   ",
