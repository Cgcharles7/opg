  "summary": "Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups is a book about geometry and group theory by John Conway and Neil Sloane, with contributions by other mathematicians, first published in 1988.\nH. S. M. Coxeter noted, \"Much of the book is inspired by the Leech lattice.\" The book covers many results that, as Richard K. Guy phrased it, \"appear little short of miraculous\", such as how the Leech lattice, a set of points in 24-dimensional space, is related via special relativity to stacking cannonballs. The interr",
