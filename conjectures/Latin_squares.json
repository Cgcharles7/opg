  "rephrased": "A Latin square is an n × n grid filled with n distinct symbols, each appearing exactly once in every row and column.",
  "implication_form": "If n is a positive integer, then there exists an n × n Latin square.",
  "posed_by": "Leonhard Euler",
  "solved_by": "Existence for all n except 2 is proven; Euler's specific conjecture about orders 4n+2 was disproven.",
  "year_originated": 250,
  "explained": "A Latin square of order n is an n × n array where each cell contains one of n distinct symbols, such that each symbol appears exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. Formally, for symbols S = {1, 2, ..., n}, a Latin square can be represented as a function L: {1, 2, ..., n} × {1, 2, ..., n} → S, such that for each fixed i, the map j ↦ L(i,j) is a bijection from {1, 2, ..., n} to S, and for each fixed k, the map i ↦ L(i,k) is a bijection from {1, 2, ..., n} to S.",
