  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson%E2%80%93Seymour_theorem",
  "rephrased": "If a family of graphs is closed under taking minors, then it can be described by forbidding a finite number of specific graphs.",
  "implication_form": "If a family of graphs is closed under taking minors, then there exists a finite set of graphs such that the family consists exactly of graphs that do not contain any of these forbidden graphs as minors.",
  "posed_by": "Neil Robertson and Paul Seymour",

  "year_originated": "40",
  "explained": "The Robertson–Seymour theorem (also known as the graph minors theorem) states that the set of all undirected graphs, ordered by the relation of graph minors, forms a well-quasi-ordering. This means that there are no infinite strictly decreasing sequences of graphs (antichains) and that any property of graphs that is closed under taking minors can be characterized by forbidding a finite set of specific graphs (forbidden minors). In other words, every minor-closed family of graphs can be defined by a finite list of forbidden minors.",
