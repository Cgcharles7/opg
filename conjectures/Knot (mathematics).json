  "summary": "In mathematics, a knot is an embedding of the circle (S1)  into three-dimensional Euclidean space, R3 (also known as E3).  Often two knots are considered equivalent if they are ambient isotopic, that is, if there exists a continuous deformation of R3 which takes one knot to the other. \nA crucial difference between the standard mathematical and conventional notions of a knot is that mathematical knots are closed â€” there are no ends to tie or untie on a mathematical knot.
