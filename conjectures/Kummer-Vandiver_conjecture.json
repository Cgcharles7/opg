  "explained": "The Kummer-Vandiver conjecture is a statement in number theory that a prime \\(p\\) does not divide the class number of the maximal real subfield of the \\(p\\)-th cyclotomic field. It is equivalent to stating that \\(p\\) does not divide the second factor (\\(h_{2}\\)) of the class number of the \\(p\\)-th cyclotomic field. This conjecture has important implications, most notably that if it is true, Fermat's Last Theorem holds for the exponent \\(p\\). ",
