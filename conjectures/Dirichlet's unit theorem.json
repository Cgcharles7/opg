  "summary": "In mathematics, Dirichlet's unit theorem is a basic result in algebraic number theory due to Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. It determines the rank of the group of units in the ring OK of algebraic integers of a number field K. The regulator is a positive real number that determines how \"dense\" the units are.\nThe statement is that the group of units is finitely generated and has rank (maximal number of multiplicatively independent elements) equal to\n\nwhere r1 is the number of real embeddings and",
