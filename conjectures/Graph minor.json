  "summary": "In graph theory, an undirected graph H is called a minor of the graph G if H can be formed from G by deleting edges, vertices and by contracting edges.\nThe theory of graph minors began with Wagner's theorem that a graph is planar if and only if its minors include neither the complete graph K5 nor the complete bipartite graph K3,3. The Robertsonâ€“Seymour theorem implies that an analogous forbidden minor characterization exists for every property of graphs that is preserved by deletions and edge co",
