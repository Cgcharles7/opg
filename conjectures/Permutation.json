  "summary": "In mathematics, a permutation of a set can mean one of two different things:\n\nan arrangement of its members in a sequence or linear order, or\nthe act or process of changing the linear order of an ordered set.\nAn example of the first meaning is the six permutations (orderings) of the set {1, 2, 3}: written as tuples, they are (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), and (3, 2, 1). Anagrams of a word whose letters are all different are also permutations: the letters are already order",
