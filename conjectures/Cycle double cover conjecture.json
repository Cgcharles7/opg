  "summary": "In graph-theoretic mathematics, a cycle double cover is a collection of cycles in an undirected graph that together include each edge of the graph exactly twice. For instance, for any polyhedral graph, the faces of a convex polyhedron that represents the graph provide a double cover of the graph: each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\nIt is an unsolved problem, posed by W. T. Tutte, Itai and Rodeh, George Szekeres and Paul Seymour and known as the cycle double cover conjecture, whether every br",
