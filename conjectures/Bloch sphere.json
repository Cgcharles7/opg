  "summary": "In quantum mechanics and computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit), named after the physicist Felix Bloch.\nMathematically each quantum mechanical system is associated with a separable complex Hilbert space \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H}\n  \n. A pure state of a quantum system is represented by a non-zero vector \n  \n    \n      \n        Ïˆ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\psi }\n  \n i",
