  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%A1rf%C3%A1s%E2%80%93Sumner_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "For any given tree and complete graph, there exists a fixed number of colors such that any graph without those specific tree or complete graph as an induced subgraph can be properly colored with that constant number of colors.",
  "implication_form": "If a graph does not contain a given tree or complete graph as an induced subgraph, then it can be properly colored using at most a constant number of colors.",
  "posed_by": "Gyárfás and Sumner",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 40,
  "explained": "The Gyárfás–Sumner conjecture states that for any given tree T and complete graph K, there exists a constant c(T,K) such that every graph that does not contain T or K as an induced subgraph has a chromatic number at most c(T,K). In other words, if a graph avoids having T or K as an induced subgraph, then its chromatic number is bounded by some constant that depends only on T and K, not on the size of the graph.",
