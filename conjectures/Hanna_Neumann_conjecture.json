  "rephrased": "The rank (minimum number of generators) of the intersection of any two finitely generated subgroups of a free group is at most the product of their individual ranks minus one.",
  "implication_form": "If H and K are finitely generated subgroups of a free group, then the rank of their intersection H ∩ K is at most (rank(H) * rank(K)) - 1.",
