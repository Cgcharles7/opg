  "summary": "In number theory, specifically the study of Diophantine approximation, the lonely runner conjecture is a conjecture about the long-term behavior of runners on a circular track. It states that \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n runners on a track of unit length, with constant speeds all distinct from one another, will each be lonely at some timeâ€”at least \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        \n          /\n        \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1/n}\n  \n units awa",
