  "summary": "In the mathematical field of spectral graph theory, Brouwer's conjecture is a conjecture by Andries Brouwer on upper bounds for the intermediate sums of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian of a graph in term of its number of edges.\nThe conjecture states that if G is a simple undirected graph and L(G) its Laplacian matrix, then its eigenvalues λn(L(G)) ≤ λn−1(L(G)) ≤ ... ≤ λ1(L(G)) satisfy\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          ",
