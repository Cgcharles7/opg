  "summary": "In mathematics, the gradient conjecture, due to René Thom (1989), was proved in 2000 by three Polish mathematicians, Krzysztof Kurdyka (University of Savoie, France), Tadeusz Mostowski (Warsaw University, Poland) and Adam Parusiński (University of Angers, France).\nThe conjecture states that given a real-valued analytic function f defined on Rn and a trajectory x(t) of the gradient vector field of f having a limit point x0 ∈ Rn, where f has an isolated critical point at x0, there exists a limit (",
