  "summary": "In abstract algebra, an endomorphism is a homomorphism from a mathematical object to itself. More generally in category theory, an endomorphism is a morphism from a category of objects to itself. An endomorphism that is also an isomorphism is an automorphism. For example, an endomorphism of a vector space V is a linear map f: V → V, and an endomorphism of a group G is a group homomorphism f: G → G. \n\nIn general, we can talk about endomorphisms in any category. In the category of sets, endomorphi",
