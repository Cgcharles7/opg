  "rephrased": "A conjecture about the stability conditions for vector bundles on algebraic curves.",

  "explained": "Lange's conjecture, proposed by Herbert Lange, pertains to the Brill-Noether theory for vector bundles on algebraic curves. It addresses the existence and properties of stable vector bundles of fixed rank and determinant on a curve of genus g. Specifically, it concerns the Brill-Noether variety parameterizing semistable vector bundles of rank r and fixed determinant with specified invariants, and conjectured that under certain conditions, this variety is non-empty and has the expected dimension. This conjecture was proven by Montserrat Teixidor i Bigas and Barbara Russo in 1999.",
