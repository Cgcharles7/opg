  "name": "Carathéodory conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "A sufficiently smooth, closed, and convex surface in three-dimensional space must have at least two points where the principal curvatures are equal (umbilic points).",
  "implication_form": "If a surface is closed, convex, and sufficiently smooth, then it must have at least two umbilic points.",
  "posed_by": "Constantin Carathéodory",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 100,
  "explained": "The Carathéodory conjecture states that any smooth, closed, and convex surface embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space must have at least two points known as umbilic points. An umbilic point is a location on the surface where the two principal curvatures are equal, meaning the surface curves equally in all directions at that point.",
