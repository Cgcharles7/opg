  "summary": "The Carathéodory conjecture, proposed by Constantin Carathéodory in 1923, states that any sufficiently smooth, closed, and convex surface in 3D Euclidean space must have at least two umbilic points. An umbilic point is a location on a surface where the curvature is the same in all directions, meaning the principal curvatures are equal. The conjecture has been the subject of much research and is considered a fundamental problem in differential geometry, though it has not yet been fully proven for all smooth surfaces. ",
