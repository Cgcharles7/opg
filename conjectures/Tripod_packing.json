  "explained": "The Tripod packing conjecture, formulated by Sherman K. Stein in 1967, concerns the maximum density achievable by packing the three-dimensional integer lattice \\(\\mathbb{Z}^3\\) with disjoint copies of a specific infinite polycube shape called a 'tripod' (or 'semicross' or 'Stein corner'). A tripod is defined as the union of all grid cubes along three infinite rays emanating from a single apex cube, one along each of the positive x, y, and z-axes. The conjecture posits that it is possible to pack the lattice with tripods achieving a certain positive asymptotic density.",
