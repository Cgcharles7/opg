  "summary": "In the mathematical field of graph theory, the bondage number of a nonempty graph G is the cardinality of the smallest set of edges whose removal results in a domination number strictly greater than the domination number Î³(G) of G. The bondage number is denoted b(G).\nThe concept was introduced by Fink et al. in 1990 and measures the vulnerability of a graph's domination structure to edge removal.",
