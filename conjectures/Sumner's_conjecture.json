  "name": "Sumner's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumner%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Any tree with n vertices, when oriented (each edge directed), can be found as a subgraph within a tournament of 2n-2 vertices.",
  "implication_form": "If a graph is an orientation of an n-vertex tree, then it is a subgraph of every (2n-2)-vertex tournament.",
  "posed_by": "David Sumner",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 50,
  "explained": "Sumner's conjecture (also known as Sumner's universal tournament conjecture) is a conjecture in extremal graph theory. It states that for any positive integer n and any orientation of any n-vertex tree, this oriented tree is isomorphic to a subtournament of every tournament on 2n-2 vertices.",
