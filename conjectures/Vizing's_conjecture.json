  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizing%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "For any two graphs G and H, the domination number of their Cartesian product is at least the product of their individual domination numbers.",
  "implication_form": "If G and H are graphs, then the domination number of G ◻ H is at least γ(G) times γ(H).",
  "posed_by": "Vadim G. Vizing",

  "year_originated": 55,
  "explained": "Vizing's conjecture states that for any two graphs G and H, the domination number of their Cartesian product G □ H is at least the product of the domination numbers of G and H. Formally, if γ(G) denotes the domination number of graph G, then γ(G □ H) ≥ γ(G) * γ(H).",
