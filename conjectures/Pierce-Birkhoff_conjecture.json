  "name": "Pierce–Birkhoff conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce%E2%80%93Birkhoff_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Any function that is piecewise defined by polynomials can be expressed as the maximum over a finite set of minima, where each minimum is taken over a finite set of polynomials.",
  "implication_form": "If a function is piecewise-polynomial, then it can be expressed as the maximum of finite minima of finite collections of polynomials.",
  "posed_by": "Garrett Birkhoff and Richard S. Pierce (initially stated informally), Melvin Henriksen and John R. Isbell (formalized the rigorous statement)",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 67,
  "explained": "The Pierce-Birkhoff conjecture, formulated in the context of lattice-ordered rings (l-rings) or f-rings, states that any piecewise-polynomial function defined on a compact interval (typically [0,1]) can be expressed as the supremum (maximum) of a finite collection of infima (minima) of finite collections of polynomials.",
