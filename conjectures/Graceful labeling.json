  "summary": "In graph theory, a graceful labeling of a graph with m edges is a labeling of its vertices with some subset of the integers from 0 to m inclusive, such that no two vertices share a label, and each edge is uniquely identified by the absolute difference between its endpoints, such that this magnitude lies between 1 and m inclusive.  A graph which admits a graceful labeling is called a graceful graph.\nThe name \"graceful labeling\" is due to Solomon W. Golomb; this type of labeling was originally giv",
