  "rephrased": "The Zeeman conjecture asks whether the product of any contractible 2-dimensional CW complex with the unit interval [0,1] is collapsible.",
  "implication_form": "If a 2-complex is contractible, then its product with the unit interval is collapsible.",
  "posed_by": "Edwin Zeeman",
  "solved_by": "Unsolved",
  "year_originated": 50,
  "explained": "The Zeeman conjecture states that given a finite contractible 2-dimensional CW complex K, the product space K × [0,1] is collapsible. An equivalent restatement is that for any 2-dimensional simplicial complex G (which is a triangulated version of a contractible CW complex), the product G × [0,1] is collapsible.",
