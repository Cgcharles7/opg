  "summary": "In mathematics, specifically complex analysis, the Brennan conjecture is a conjecture estimating (under specified conditions) the integral powers of the moduli of the derivatives of conformal maps into the open unit disk. The conjecture was formulated by James E. Brennan in 1978.\nLet W be a simply connected open subset of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} }\n  \n with at least two boundary points in the extended complex plane.
