  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_sumset_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "If a subset of the natural numbers is dense (has positive density), then it must contain all possible sums of two infinite subsets.",
  "implication_form": "If a subset A of the natural numbers has positive density, then A contains the sumset B+C for two infinite sets B and C.",
  "posed_by": "Paul Erdős",

  ],
  "year_originated": 40,
  "explained": "The Erdős sumset conjecture states that any subset A of the natural numbers with positive upper density must contain a sumset B+C, where B and C are infinite subsets of A. In other words, there exist two infinite subsets B and C of A such that every element in the sumset {b+c | b ∈ B, c ∈ C} is also contained in A.",
