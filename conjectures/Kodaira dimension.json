  "summary": "In algebraic geometry, the Kodaira dimension κ(X) measures the size of the canonical model of a projective variety X.\nSoviet mathematician Igor Shafarevich in a seminar introduced an important numerical invariant of surfaces with the notation κ. Japanese mathematician Shigeru Iitaka extended it and defined the Kodaira dimension for higher dimensional varieties (under the name of canonical dimension), and later named it after Kunihiko Kodaira.",
