  "summary": "In algebraic geometry, the Virasoro conjecture states that a certain generating function encoding Gromov–Witten invariants of a smooth projective variety is fixed by an action of half of the Virasoro algebra. The Virasoro conjecture is named after theoretical physicist Miguel Ángel Virasoro. Tohru Eguchi, Kentaro Hori, and Chuan-Sheng Xiong (1997)\nproposed the Virasoro conjecture as a generalization of Witten's conjecture. Ezra Getzler (1999) gave a survey of the Virasoro conjecture.\nThe proof o",
