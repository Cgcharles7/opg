  "rephrased": "Every elliptic curve defined over the rational numbers is associated with a specific modular form.",
  "implication_form": "If an elliptic curve is defined over the field of rational numbers, then it is modular.",
  "posed_by": "Jean-Pierre Serre (conjectured the 'BSD conjecture' which includes the modularity conjecture for semistable curves), Yves Hellegouarch, Gerhard Frey, and others.",
  "solved_by": "Andrew Wiles (with Richard Taylor) for semistable elliptic curves (enough for FLT), Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond, Christophe Breuil, and Richard Taylor (completed the proof).",
  "year_originated": 50,
  "explained": "The Modularity Theorem (formerly known as the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture) states that every rational elliptic curve is modular, meaning it can be associated with a modular form (specifically, a weight 2 newform for the principal congruence subgroup). More precisely, it asserts that for any elliptic curve E defined over the field of rational numbers, there exists a modular form f (of weight 2 and level N, the conductor of E) such that the L-function of E matches the L-function of f (up to finitely many factors). This connection links the algebraic properties of elliptic curves to the analytic properties of modular forms.",
