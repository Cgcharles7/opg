  "summary": "In graph theory, an eternal dominating set for a graph G = (V, E) is a subset D of V such that D is a dominating set on which mobile guards are initially located (at most one guard may be located on any vertex). The set D must be such that for any infinite sequence of attacks occurring sequentially at vertices, the set D can be modified by moving a guard from an adjacent vertex to the attacked vertex, provided the attacked vertex has no guard on it at the time it is attacked.
