  "name": "Hilbert's tenth problem",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem",
  "rephrased": "Is there a universal algorithm that can determine, for any given polynomial equation with integer coefficients and finitely many unknowns, whether it has integer solutions?",
  "implication_form": "If a general algorithm exists that can solve all Diophantine equations, then it would correctly determine the existence of integer solutions for every such equation.",
  "posed_by": "David Hilbert",
  "solved_by": "Martin Davis, Julia Robinson, Yuri Matiyasevich (proving undecidability)",
  "year_originated": 124,
  "explained": "Hilbert's tenth problem asks for an algorithm that can determine, for any given Diophantine equation (a polynomial equation with integer coefficients and a finite number of unknowns), whether there exist integer solutions. For example, the equation 3x + y = 5 has integer solutions, while the equation x² + y² + z² = 7 has none.",
