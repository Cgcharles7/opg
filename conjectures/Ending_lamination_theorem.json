  "rephrased": "A complete hyperbolic 3-manifold is uniquely determined by its topological type and the geometric structures (conformal at finite ends or ending laminations at infinite ends) of its ends.",
  "implication_form": "If two complete hyperbolic 3-manifolds are topologically equivalent and have identical end invariants (conformal structures for finite ends or ending laminations for infinite ends), then they are isometric (geometrically identical).",
  "posed_by": "Bill Thurston (conjectured)",
  "solved_by": "Kahn and Markovic (proved)",
  "year_originated": "Approximately 40 years (late 1970s/early 1980s)",
  "explained": "The Ending Lamination Theorem is a fundamental theorem in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. It states that if two complete, orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds are homeomorphic, then they are isometric if and only if they have the same ending invariants. For a geometrically infinite end, the ending invariant is a geodesic lamination (called the ending lamination) on the corresponding punctured torus boundary. For a geometrically finite end, the ending invariant is the conformal structure at infinity. The theorem uniquely determines the hyperbolic structure of the manifold from its topology and these ending invariants.",
