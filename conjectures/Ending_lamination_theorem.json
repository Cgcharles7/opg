  "summary": "The Ending Lamination Theorem is a fundamental result in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds that proves a unique relationship between the geometric structure of a manifold's ends and their corresponding \"ending laminations\". Specifically, it states that a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold is uniquely determined by the ending laminations of its ends (if the ends are geometrically finite or tame). It establishes that for each end, there is a unique lamination on the boundary surface, which is determined by the limiting behavior of certain sequences of geodesics from the manifold's interior. ",
  "head": "You have two complete hyperbolic 3-manifolds (\\(M_{1}\\) and \\(M_{2}\\)) that are topologically equivalent (homeomorphic) and have the same end invariants (conformal structures for geometrically finite ends, and ending laminations for geometrically infinite ends).", 
  "tail": "The two manifolds are isometric (geometrically identical). ",
