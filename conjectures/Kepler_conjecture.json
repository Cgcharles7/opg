  "name": "Kepler conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The Kepler conjecture states that the maximum average density achievable by packing identical spheres in three-dimensional space is approximately 74.05%, which is the density found in face-centered cubic and hexagonal close packing arrangements.",
  "implication_form": "If spheres of equal size are packed in three-dimensional Euclidean space, then the average density cannot exceed that of face-centered cubic or hexagonal close packing arrangements.",
  "posed_by": "Johannes Kepler",
  "solved_by": "Thomas Hales (1998)",
  "year_originated": 412,
  "explained": "The Kepler conjecture states that the maximum density achievable in a packing of identical spheres in three-dimensional Euclidean space is π / √18 ≈ 0.74048049123, which is the density achieved by both the face-centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) arrangements. This means that no arrangement of spheres can achieve a higher average density than these close-packed structures.",
