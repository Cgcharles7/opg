  "summary": "In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, the linear arboricity of an undirected graph is the smallest number of linear forests its edges can be partitioned into. Here, a linear forest is an acyclic graph with maximum degree two; that is, it is a disjoint union of path graphs. Linear arboricity is a variant of arboricity, the minimum number of forests into which the edges can be partitioned.\nThe linear arboricity of any graph of maximum degree \n  \n    \n      \n        Î”\n      \n    \n    {\\displays",
