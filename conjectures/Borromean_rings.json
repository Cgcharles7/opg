  "summary": "Borromean rings are three interlinked rings that fall apart if any single ring is removed, symbolizing strength in unity and interdependence. This symbol has been used to represent the Christian Trinity (as the \"Trinity Rings\"), the aristocratic Borromeo family's coat of arms, and more broadly, the interconnectedness of life and causality. Historically, a similar symbol appeared in ancient Norse art as the valknut.  ",
