  "explained": "Borromean rings are defined as a specific configuration of three unlinked rings that are interlocked such that the removal of any one ring causes the entire structure to fall apart. This configuration demonstrates a unique form of interdependence where the rings are linked, yet pairwise unlinked. The rings are typically depicted as oval-shaped and arranged symmetrically. Borromean rings are a prime example of a Brunnian link of rank three.",
