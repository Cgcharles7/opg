  "explained": "Babai's problem in graph theory conjectures that in any 3-connected graph where the longest cycles have length c, any two longest cycles must share at least f(c) vertices. Here, f(c) is a function that grows without bound as c increases (i.e., f(c) → ∞ as c → ∞). This means that longer graphs cannot have arbitrarily short intersections between their longest cycles.",
