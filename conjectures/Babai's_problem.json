  "summary": "Babai's problem from 1979 refers to an unsolved problem in algebraic graph theory regarding the intersection of the longest cycles in a graph. More specifically, it asks whether in a \\(3\\)-connected graph with a longest cycle of length \\(c\\), any two longest cycles must intersect in at least \\(f(c)\\) vertices, where \\(f(c)\\rightarrow \\infty \\) as \\(c\\rightarrow \\infty \\). The term is also associated with a different problem in computer science, the graph isomorphism problem, which László Babai worked on and made a breakthrough in 2015. ",
