  "name": "Double bubble conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bubble_theorem",
  "rephrased": "The Double Bubble Conjecture states that the minimal surface area configuration for enclosing two separate volumes in 3D space is a double bubble shape consisting of three spherical caps meeting along a shared circle at 120-degree angles.",
  "implication_form": "If two volumes are enclosed by a surface in 3D space, then the configuration with the minimal surface area is the standard double bubble shape.",
  "posed_by": "The conjecture refers to the widely believed minimal surface configuration, but specific attribution to original proposers is unclear; it emerged from the study of soap films and minimal surfaces.",
  "solved_by": "Michael Hutchings, Frank Morgan, Manuel Ritoré, and Antonio Ros (proven in 2000)",
