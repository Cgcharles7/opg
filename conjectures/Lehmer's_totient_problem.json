  "posed_by": "D. H. Lehmer",

  "explained": "Lehmer's totient problem is an unsolved conjecture in number theory that asks whether there exists any composite number n such that Euler's totient function φ(n) divides n − 1. It is known that φ(n) = n − 1 if and only if n is prime. Therefore, the conjecture posits that for composite numbers, φ(n) does not divide n − 1, and all composite numbers fail to satisfy this divisibility condition.",
