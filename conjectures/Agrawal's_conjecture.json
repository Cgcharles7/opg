  "summary": "In number theory, Agrawal's conjecture, due to Manindra Agrawal in 2002, forms the basis for the cyclotomic AKS test. Agrawal's conjecture states formally:\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  \n be two coprime positive integers. If \n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        X\n        −\n        1\n        \n          )\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        ≡\n        \n          X\n          \n      ",
