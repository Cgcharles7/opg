  "summary": "The cyclotomic AKS test in number theory is based on Agrawal's conjecture, which was proposed by Manindra Agrawal in 2002 [1]. Formally, Agrawal's conjecture says:<br><br>Assume two coprime positive integers, {\\displaystyle n} and {\\displaystyle r}. Either {\\displaystyle n} is prime or {\\displaystyle n^{2}\\equiv 1{\\pmod {r}}} if {\\displaystyle (X-1)^{n}\\equiv X^{n}-1{\\pmod {n,\\,X^{r}-1}}\\,}",
