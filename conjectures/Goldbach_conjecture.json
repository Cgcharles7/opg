  "name": "Goldbach conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Every even number greater than two can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.",
  "implication_form": "If a number is even and greater than two, then it can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.",
  "posed_by": "Christian Goldbach",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 282,
  "explained": "Goldbach's conjecture states that every even natural number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. For example, 4 = 2 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 8 = 3 + 5, 10 = 3 + 7 or 5 + 5, and so on. While this has been verified for all even numbers up to 4 × 10¹⁸, it remains an unproven conjecture in mathematics.",
