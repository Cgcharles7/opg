  "summary": "The Bass–Quillen conjecture states that any finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring of a regular Noetherian ring is \"extended\" from the original ring. In simpler terms, it connects the properties of vector bundles on a polynomial space to those on its base space. This conjecture is a fundamental result in commutative algebra that was largely proven in special cases but remains open in its most general form. ",
