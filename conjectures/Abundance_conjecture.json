  "rephrased": "If a projective variety with Kawamata log terminal singularities has a nef canonical bundle, then some sufficiently large multiple of that bundle is base-point free.",

  "solved_by": "No one fully solved it yet, but Caucher Birkar has established important cases",
  "year_originated": "30-40 years (estimated)",
  "explained": "The Abundance Conjecture is a central problem in algebraic geometry that states if a projective variety has a nef (numerically) canonical bundle, then it must be semi-ample. In simpler terms, it predicts that a certain type of geometric object with a \"good\" canonical bundle will have a \"good\" model with specific properties, meaning the canonical bundle will be generated by a global section and behave nicely. Proving this conjecture is a major goal in the minimal model program, and important cases have been proven. ",
