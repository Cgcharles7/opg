  "summary": "The abundance conjecture in algebraic geometry is a birational geometry conjecture, specifically in the minimal model program, which states that if the canonical bundle {\\displaystyle K_{X}} is nef, then {\\displaystyle K_{X}} is semi-ample, meaning that {\\displaystyle mK_{X}} is base-point free for some {\\displaystyle m>0}. This is true for every projective variety {\\displaystyle X} with Kawamata log terminal singularities over a field {\\displaystyle k}. Specifically, if abundance is maintained, the model {\\displaystyle X\\rightarrow Y=\\mathrm {Proj} \\bigoplus _{l\\geqslant 0}H^{0}(X,lK_{X})$ can be defined.<br><br>Caucher Birkar has established important cases of the abundance conjecture.[1]",
