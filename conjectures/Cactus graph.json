  "summary": "In graph theory, a cactus (sometimes called a cactus tree) is a connected graph in which any two simple cycles have at most one vertex in common. Equivalently, it is a connected graph in which every edge belongs to at most one simple cycle, or (for nontrivial cacti) in which every block (maximal subgraph without a cut-vertex) is an edge or a cycle.",
