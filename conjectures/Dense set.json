  "summary": "In topology and related areas of mathematics, a subset A of a topological space X is said to be dense in X if every point of X either belongs to A or else is arbitrarily \"close\" to a member of A â€” for instance, the rational numbers are a dense subset of the real numbers because every real number either is a rational number or has a rational number arbitrarily close to it (see Diophantine approximation). \nFormally, \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n  \n is dense in \n  \n  ",
