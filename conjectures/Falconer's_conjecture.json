  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconer%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "If a set of points in d-dimensional space is sufficiently large (with a Hausdorff dimension exceeding d/2), then the set of all possible distances between points in that set must be significant (have positive Lebesgue measure).",
  "implication_form": "If a compact subset E of R^d (d ≥ 2) has Hausdorff dimension greater than d/2, then the set { |x - y| : x, y ∈ E } has positive Lebesgue measure.",
