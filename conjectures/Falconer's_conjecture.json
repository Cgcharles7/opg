  "summary": "Falconer's conjecture is an unsolved problem in geometric measure theory that states that a compact set of points in \\(d\\)-dimensional Euclidean space with a Hausdorff dimension greater than \\(d/2\\) must have a distance set of strictly positive Lebesgue measure. Intuitively, the conjecture suggests that a sufficiently \"large\" or \"dense\" set of points will determine a set of distances that is also \"large\" and not just a few isolated values. The conjecture is considered a continuous analogue of the Erdős distance problem for finite sets of points. ",
  "head": "If \\(E\\) is a compact subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) (where \\(d\\ge 2\\)) with Hausdorff dimension strictly greater than \\(d/2\\)", 
  "tail": "then its distance set \\(\\Delta (E)=\\{|x-y|:x,y\\in E\\}\\) has positive one-dimensional Lebesgue measure. ",
