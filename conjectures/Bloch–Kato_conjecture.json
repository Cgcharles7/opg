  "summary": "In mathematics,  the norm residue isomorphism theorem is a long-sought result relating Milnor K-theory and Galois cohomology. The result has a relatively elementary formulation and at the same time represents the key juncture in the proofs of many seemingly unrelated theorems from abstract algebra, theory of quadratic forms, algebraic K-theory and the theory of motives. The theorem asserts that a certain statement  holds true for any prime \n  \n    \n      \n        ℓ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle",
