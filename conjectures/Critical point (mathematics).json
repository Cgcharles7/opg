  "summary": "In mathematics, a critical point is the argument of a function where the function derivative is zero (or undefined, as specified below).\nThe value of the function at a critical point is a critical value.\nMore specifically, when dealing with functions of a real variable, a critical point is a point in the domain of the function where the function derivative is equal to zero (also known as a stationary point) or where the function is not differentiable. Similarly, when dealing with complex variabl",
