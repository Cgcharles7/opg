  "summary": "The Berry–Robbins problem is a question in mathematics about whether a continuous map exists between two specific mathematical spaces—the configuration space of \\(n\\) points in 3D space and the flag manifold \\(U(n)/T^{n}\\)—that respects the symmetries of the spaces. This problem arose from an attempt by Berry and Robbins to generalize their work on the spin-statistics theorem for \\(n\\) particles and was solved positively by Michael Atiyah, who proved the existence of such a map. ",
