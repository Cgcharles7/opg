  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry%E2%80%93Robbins_problem",
  "rephrased": "Does a continuous map exist from the configuration space of n distinct points in 3D space to the flag manifold U(n)/T^n that is invariant under the symmetries of the configuration space?",
  "implication_form": "If a continuous map respecting the symmetries exists between these spaces, then it satisfies certain properties (but the core question is the existence itself, not a conditional statement).",
