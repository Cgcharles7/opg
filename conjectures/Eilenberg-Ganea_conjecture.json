  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilenberg%E2%80%93Ganea_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "If a group has cohomological dimension 2, then it can be represented by a 2-dimensional Eilenberg-MacLane space.",
  "implication_form": "If a group has cohomological dimension 2, then it has geometric dimension 2.",
  "posed_by": [

  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 55,
  "explained": "The Eilenberg–Ganea conjecture states that if a group G has cohomological dimension 2 (cd(G) = 2), then it also has geometric dimension 2. Geometric dimension 2 means that G admits a 2-dimensional Eilenberg–MacLane space (aspherical CW complex).",
