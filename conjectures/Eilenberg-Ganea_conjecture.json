  "summary": "The Eilenberg–Ganea conjecture is a still-unsolved problem in algebraic topology that asks if every group with a cohomological dimension of 2 must also have a geometric dimension of 2. It states that a group \\(G\\) has a 2-dimensional aspherical CW complex, meaning a 2-dimensional Eilenberg–MacLane space, if its cohomological dimension is 2. While the conjecture is true for some families of groups, it is known that not both it and the Whitehead conjecture can be true simultaneously, as demonstrated by a 1997 result from Bestvina and Brady. ",
