  "summary": "In mathematics, a Riemannian manifold is said to be flat if its Riemann curvature tensor is everywhere zero. Intuitively, a flat manifold is one that \"locally looks like\" Euclidean space in terms of distances and angles, e.g. the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180Â°.\nThe universal cover of a complete flat manifold is Euclidean space. This can be used to prove the theorem of \nBieberbach (1911, 1912) that all compact flat manifolds are finitely covered by tori; the 3-dimensional case was p",
