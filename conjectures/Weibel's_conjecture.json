  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibel%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "There exists a criterion that allows one to determine when negative algebraic K-theory groups vanish.",
  "implication_form": "If certain conditions are met (related to the vanishing of other cohomological invariants), then the negative algebraic K-theory groups vanish.",

  "explained": "Weibel's conjecture addresses the vanishing of negative algebraic K-theory groups for schemes. It posits a criterion under which the negative K-groups vanish, often related to the dimension of the scheme or other geometric properties. The conjecture states that for a regular scheme X of dimension n, the negative K-groups K_i(X) vanish for i < -(n-1). Furthermore, it proposes a more general criterion involving the vanishing of K-theory with coefficients related to the structure sheaf.",
