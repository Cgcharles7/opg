  "rephrased": "If a polynomial map from an n-dimensional space to itself has a constant non-zero Jacobian determinant, then it has a polynomial inverse.",
  "implication_form": "If a polynomial map has a constant non-zero Jacobian determinant, then it has a polynomial inverse.",
  "posed_by": "Ott-Heinrich Keller",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 85,
  "explained": "The Jacobian conjecture states that if a polynomial function from an n-dimensional complex affine space to itself has a constant non-zero Jacobian determinant, then it is invertible, and its inverse is also a polynomial function.",
