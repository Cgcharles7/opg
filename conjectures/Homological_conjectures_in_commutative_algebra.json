  "rephrased": "If a commutative ring R is a homomorphic image of a Gorenstein ring and S is a direct summand of R as an R-module, then S is also a homomorphic image of a Goren'tstein ring.",
  "implication_form": "If R is a homomorphic image of a Gorenstein ring and S is a direct summand of R as an R-module, then S is a homomorphic image of a Gorenstein ring.",
  "posed_by": "Melvin Hochster",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 1973,
  "explained": "The \"Homological Conjectures\" are a collection of interrelated statements in commutative algebra that connect the homological properties of a ring to its internal structure. These conjectures, which originated from the work of mathematicians like Jean-Pierre Serre, Maurice Auslander, and others, relate concepts like projective dimension, Cohen-Macaulay modules, and direct summands. While many were resolved for rings containing a field, some remained open for \"mixed characteristic\" (where the ring does not contain a field of the same characteristic as its characteristic ideal) until recent breakthroughs, such as the proof of the Direct Summand Conjecture.",
