  "summary": "Hilbert's ninth problem, from the list of 23 Hilbert's problems (1900), asked to find the most general reciprocity law for the norm residues of k-th order in a general algebraic number field, where k is a power of a prime.\nProblem was partially solved for abelian extensions by Artin reciprocity and class field theory for abelian extensions of number fields. Generaliztion of this results to non-abelian class field theory seems to be one of the most challenging problems in algebraic number theory,",
