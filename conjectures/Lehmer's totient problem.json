  "summary": "In mathematics, Lehmer's totient problem asks whether there is any composite number n such that Euler's totient function φ(n) divides n − 1.  This is an unsolved problem.\nIt is known that φ(n) = n − 1 if and only if n is prime. So for every prime number n, we have φ(n) = n − 1 and thus in particular φ(n) divides n − 1.  D. H. Lehmer conjectured in 1932 that there are no composite numbers with this property.",
