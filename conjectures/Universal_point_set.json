  "rephrased": null,
  "implication_form": "If a graph is planar and has n vertices, then it can be drawn using a universal point set of order n.",
  "posed_by": "Unknown",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 1990,
  "explained": "The Universal Point Set conjecture states that for every positive integer n, there exists a set S of n points in the Euclidean plane such that every n-vertex planar graph can be embedded as a straight-line drawing using only points from S. This means that a single set of points can be used to draw all possible n-vertex planar graphs with straight edges, without any two edges crossing (except at vertices). The conjecture is still unproven for all n.",
