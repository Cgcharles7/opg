  "summary": "In mathematics, the isoperimetric inequality is a geometric inequality involving the square of the circumference of a closed curve in the plane and the area of a plane region it encloses, as well as its various generalizations. Isoperimetric literally means \"having the same perimeter\". Specifically, the isoperimetric inequality states, for the length L of a closed curve and the area A of the planar region that it encloses, that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        4\n        π\n        A\n        ≤\n        \n   ",
