  "rephrased": "For any square complex matrix A and any complex polynomial p, the operator norm of p(A) is bounded by twice the maximum value that |p(z)| takes on the numerical range W(A) of A.",
  "implication_form": "If A is a square complex matrix and p is a complex polynomial, then ||p(A)|| ≤ 2 * sup_{z∈W(A)} |p(z)|.",

  "year_originated": "10-15",
  "explained": "Crouze's conjecture states that for any square complex matrix \\(A\\) and any complex polynomial \\(p\\), the matrix norm of \\(p(A)\\) is bounded by twice the maximum value of \\(|p(z)|\\) for \\(z\\) in the numerical range \\(W(A)\\) of \\(A\\). This is expressed as \\(\\|p(A)\\| \\leq 2 \\sup_{z \\in W(A)} |p(z)|\\). This inequality is conjectured to hold for all square complex matrices \\(A\\) and all complex polynomials \\(p\\), although it remains unproven.",
