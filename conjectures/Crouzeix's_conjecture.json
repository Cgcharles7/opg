  "summary": "Crouzeix's conjecture is an unsolved problem in matrix analysis. It was proposed by Michel Crouzeix in 2004, and it can be stated as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ‖\n        f\n        (\n        A\n        )\n        ‖\n        ≤\n        2\n        \n          sup\n          \n            z\n            ∈\n            W\n            (\n            A\n            )\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n        f\n        (\n        z\n        )\n        \n          |\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n  ",
