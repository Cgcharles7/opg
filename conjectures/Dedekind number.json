  "summary": "In mathematics, the Dedekind numbers are a rapidly growing sequence of integers named after Richard Dedekind, who defined them in 1897. The Dedekind number \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M(n)}\n  \n is the number of monotone Boolean functions of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n variables. Equivalently, it is the number of antichains of subsets of an \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n",
