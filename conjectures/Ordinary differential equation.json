  "summary": "In mathematics, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a differential equation (DE) dependent on only a single independent variable. As with any other DE, its unknown(s) consists of one (or more) function(s) and involves the derivatives of those functions. The term \"ordinary\" is used in contrast with partial differential equations (PDEs) which may be with respect to more than one independent variable, and, less commonly, in contrast with stochastic differential equations (SDEs) where the pro",
