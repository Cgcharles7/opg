  "rephrased": "A graph with chromatic number k+1 requires at least k complete bipartite subgraphs in any edge-partition.",
  "implication_form": "If a graph has chromatic number k+1, then it requires at least k complete bipartite subgraphs to cover its edges (in any edge-partition).",

  "year_originated": 30,
  "explained": "The Alon–Saks–Seymour conjecture proposed that if a graph's edges can be partitioned into m edge-disjoint complete bipartite graphs, then the graph's chromatic number is at most m + 1. A key related statement is that a graph formed by the edge-disjoint union of m complete bipartite graphs is (m + 1)-colorable. This conjecture was later shown to be false, with counterexamples found in 2012. ",
