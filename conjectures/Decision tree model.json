  "summary": "In computational complexity theory, the decision tree model is the model of computation in which an algorithm can be considered to be a decision tree, i.e. a sequence of queries or tests that are done adaptively, so the outcome of previous tests can influence the tests performed next.\nTypically, these tests have a small number of outcomes (such as a yesâ€“no question) and can be performed quickly (say, with unit computational cost), so the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm in the decision",
