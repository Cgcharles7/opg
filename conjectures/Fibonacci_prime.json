  "summary": "A Fibonacci prime is a number that is both a prime number and a term in the Fibonacci sequence. The first few Fibonacci primes are 2, 3, 5, 13, 89, and 233. For a Fibonacci number with an index \\(n>4\\) to be prime, the index \\(n\\) itself must also be prime, although not all prime indices result in a prime Fibonacci number (for example, the 19th Fibonacci number is composite). ",
