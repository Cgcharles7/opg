  "explained": "The Laplace operator, or Laplacian, is a second-order differential operator named after Pierre-Simon Laplace. It is defined as the divergence of the gradient of a scalar function on Euclidean space. For a scalar function f, the Laplacian is given by the divergence of its gradient, ∇ · ∇f, which is often written as ∇²f or ∆f. In Cartesian coordinates, for a function f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ), the Laplacian is the sum of the non-mixed second partial derivatives: ∇²f = ∂²f/∂x₁² + ∂²f/∂x₂² + ... + ∂²f/∂xₙ². The Laplacian appears in various fields including mathematics, physics, and engineering, notably in the heat equation, wave equation, Poisson's equation, and in describing gravitational and fluid potentials.",
