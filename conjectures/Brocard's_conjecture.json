  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brocard%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Between the squares of consecutive prime numbers, there are at least four prime numbers.",
  "implication_form": "If n is at least 2, then there are at least four primes between the squares of the nth and (n+1)th prime.",
  "posed_by": "Henri Brocard",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 135,
  "explained": "Brocard's conjecture states that for any integer n ≥ 2, where pn is the n-th prime number, there are at least four prime numbers strictly between the squares of pn and the square of the next prime, pn+1.",
