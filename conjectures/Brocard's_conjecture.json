  "summary": "The Brocard's conjecture in number theory states that, for any n ≥ 2, there exist at least four prime numbers between (pn)2 and (pn+1)2, where pn is the nth prime number.[1] The theory bears Henri Brocard's name. This supposition is generally accepted to be accurate [2]. However, as of 2025, it has not been proven. Given that pn+1 − pn ≥ 2[3], Legendre's conjecture that there is a prime between consecutive integer squares means that there are at least two primes between prime squares for pn ≥ 3.",
