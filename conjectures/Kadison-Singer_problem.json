  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadison%E2%80%93Singer_problem",
  "rephrased": "The Kadison–Singer problem asks whether pure states on certain C*-algebras have unique extensions to larger algebras.",
  "implication_form": "If a linear functional is a pure state on a certain C*-algebra, then its extension to a larger algebra is unique.",
  "posed_by": "Richard Kadison and Isadore Singer",
  "solved_by": "Adam Marcus, Daniel Spielman, Nikhil Srivastava",
  "year_originated": 64,
  "explained": "The Kadison-Singer problem, now a theorem proved in 2013, asks: If a pure state on the C*-algebra of bounded operators on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space vanishes on the algebra of all diagonal operators (with respect to some orthonormal basis), must it be uniquely extendable to a pure state on the entire algebra of bounded operators? In simpler terms, it questions the uniqueness of extensions of certain states defined on a subalgebra to the whole algebra.",
