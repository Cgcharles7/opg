  "explained": "The 3-sphere is defined as the set of all points in 4-dimensional Euclidean space (R^4) that are at a fixed Euclidean distance, known as the radius, from a given central point (typically the origin). Mathematically, it can be expressed as the set {(x, y, z, w) ∈ R^4 | x² + y² + z² + w² = r²}, where r is the radius.",
