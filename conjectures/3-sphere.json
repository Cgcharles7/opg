  "summary": "In mathematics, the 3-dimensional n-sphere, also known as a hypersphere or 3-sphere, is the 4-dimensional counterpart of a sphere. It is the collection of points that are equally spaced from a given central point in 4-dimensional Euclidean space. A 4-ball is the interior of a 3-sphere.<br><br>Despite being curled into the fourth dimension, the surface itself is topologically three-dimensional, hence the name \"three-sphere.\" On a 3-sphere, for instance, you can move east and west, north and south, or along a third set of cardinal directions. Accordingly, a 3-sphere is an illustration of a 3-manifold.",
