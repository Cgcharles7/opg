  "summary": "In mathematics, the Sato–Tate conjecture is a statistical statement about the family of elliptic curves Ep obtained from an elliptic curve E over the rational numbers by reduction modulo almost all prime numbers p. Mikio Sato and John Tate independently posed the conjecture around 1960.\nIf Np denotes the number of points on the elliptic curve Ep defined over the finite field with p elements, the conjecture gives an answer to the distribution of the second-order term for Np.
