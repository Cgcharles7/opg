  "summary": "In mathematics, ergodicity expresses the idea that a point of a moving system, either a dynamical system or a stochastic process, will eventually visit all parts of the space in which the system moves, in a uniform and random sense. This implies that the average behavior of the system can be deduced from the trajectory of a \"typical\" point. Equivalently, a sufficiently large collection of random samples from a process can represent the average statistical properties of the entire process. Ergodi",
