  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereceda%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "With sufficiently many colors (at least d+2), any two proper colorings of a d-degenerate graph can be transformed into each other by changing one vertex's color at a time, and this transformation requires at most a number of steps proportional to the square of the graph's size.",
  "implication_form": "If G is a d-degenerate graph with n vertices and α and β are two proper vertex colorings of G using at most d+2 colors, then there exists a sequence of proper colorings transforming α to β where each step changes the color of a single vertex, and the length of this sequence is O(n²).",
  "posed_by": "Hélio Bonomo-Brubola and Luis Cereceda",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": "estimate: 2000s",
  "explained": "Cereceda's conjecture asserts that for any d-degenerate graph with n vertices, and any two proper vertex colorings using at most k = d+2 colors, it is possible to transform one coloring into the other by a sequence of recolorings where only one vertex is changed at a time. The total number of such recoloring steps required is bounded by a quadratic function of n, specifically O(n²).",
