  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereceda%27s_conjecture",
  "summary": "Cereceda's conjecture is an unsolved problem in graph theory that states two different colorings of a d-degenerate graph using k colors can be transformed into each other by changing one vertex at a time in a number of steps that is quadratic in the size of the graph, provided that k is at least d+2. This is related to the diameter of the reconfiguration graph of colorings. ",
  "head": "\\(G\\) is a \\(d\\)-degenerate graph on \\(n\\) vertices, and \\(\\alpha \\) and \\(\\beta \\) are two proper colorings of \\(G\\) using at most \\(d+2\\) colors",
  "tail": "then it is possible to transform \\(\\alpha \\) into \\(\beta \\) by changing the color of one vertex at a time, using a sequence of \\(O(n^{2})\\) steps (a number of steps at most quadratic in the number of vertices). ",
