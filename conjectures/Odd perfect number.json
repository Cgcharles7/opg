  "summary": "In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive proper divisors, that is, divisors excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has proper divisors 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number. The next perfect number is 28, because 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.\nThe first seven perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336, 8589869056, and 137438691328.\nThe sum of proper divisors of a number is called its aliquot sum, so a perfect number ",
