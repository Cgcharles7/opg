  "summary": "In mathematics, the surface subgroup conjecture of Friedhelm Waldhausen states that the fundamental group of every closed, irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group has a surface subgroup.  By \"surface subgroup\" we mean the fundamental group of a closed surface not the 2-sphere. This problem is listed as Problem 3.75 in Robion Kirby's problem list.\nAssuming the geometrization conjecture, the only open case was that of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  A proof of this case was announce",
