  "name": "Spherical space form conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_space_form_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "A finite group can be realized as a symmetry group of the 3-sphere.",
  "implication_form": "If a finite group acts faithfully on the 3-sphere, then it is conjugate to a subgroup of the isometry group of the 3-sphere.",
  "posed_by": "Heinz Bieberbach",
  "solved_by": "Grigory Perel'man",
  "year_originated": 90,
  "explained": "The Spherical Space Form Conjecture, now a theorem proven primarily by Ludwig Bieberbach (1933, 1935), Wu-Hsiang Hsiang (1966), and Jeff Cheeger and Michael Gromov (1987), states that if a finite group G acts effectively on the 3-sphere S³ by isometries (i.e., preserving the standard Riemannian metric), then G is conjugate to a finite subgroup of the orthogonal group O(4) (or equivalently, of SO(4), since S³ is the group of unit quaternions). This means G must be a finite subgroup of the isometry group of S³. The theorem classifies all finite groups that can act faithfully by isometries on the 3-sphere.",
