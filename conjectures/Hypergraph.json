  "summary": "In mathematics, a hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which an edge can join any number of vertices. In contrast, in an ordinary graph, an edge connects exactly two vertices.\nFormally, a directed hypergraph is a pair \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        E\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (X,E)}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is a set of elements called nodes, vertices, points, or elements and \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n",
