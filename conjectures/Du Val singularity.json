  "summary": "In algebraic geometry, a Du Val singularity, also called simple surface singularity, Kleinian singularity,  or rational double point, is an isolated  singularity of a complex surface which is modeled on a double branched cover of the plane, with minimal resolution  obtained by replacing the singular point with a tree of smooth rational curves, with intersection pattern dual to a  Dynkin diagram of A-D-E singularity type. They are the canonical singularities (or, equivalently, rational Gorenstein",
