  "name": "Dickson's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickson%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "If a finite set of linear forms (like n+b1, n+b2, etc.) doesn't have any 'local obstacle' (such as divisibility issues by small primes) that always prevents them from all being prime for some n, then there are infinitely many integers n where all forms evaluate to prime numbers.",
  "implication_form": "If a finite set of linear forms (ai*n + bi) has no congruence condition preventing all forms from being simultaneously prime for some integer n, then there are infinitely many integers n for which all forms evaluate to prime numbers.",
