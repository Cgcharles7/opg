  "summary": "In mathematics, the Zilber–Pink conjecture is a far-reaching generalisation of many famous Diophantine conjectures and statements, such as André–Oort, Manin–Mumford, and Mordell–Lang. For algebraic tori and semiabelian varieties it was proposed by Boris Zilber and independently by Enrico Bombieri, David Masser, Umberto Zannier in the early 2000's. For semiabelian varieties the conjecture implies the Mordell–Lang and Manin–Mumford conjectures. Richard Pink proposed (again independently) a more ge",
