  "summary": "In mathematics, specifically set theory, the continuum hypothesis (abbreviated CH) is a hypothesis about the possible sizes of infinite sets. It states:\n\nThere is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers.\nIn Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC), this is equivalent to the following equation in aleph numbers: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            \n              ℵ\n              \n                0\n             ",
