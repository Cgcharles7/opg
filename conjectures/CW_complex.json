  "explained": "A CW complex is a type of topological space constructed by gluing together cells (of various dimensions) in a specific inductive way. It is defined by attaching cells of increasing dimension, starting from a discrete set of points (0-cells), and gluing n-cells along their boundaries to existing parts of the complex (the (n-1)-skeleton). The topology of a CW complex is the weak topology, meaning it is the smallest topology that makes all the characteristic maps (used in the gluing process) continuous. CW complexes are fundamental objects in algebraic topology and are particularly well-suited for homotopy theory because their construction allows for inductive analysis and the study of homotopy types.",
