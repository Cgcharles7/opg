  "summary": "A CW complex is a topological space built by \"gluing\" together cells of different dimensions in a specific way. The \"C\" stands for \"cell,\" and the \"W\" stands for \"weak,\" referring to the topology, which is the weakest that makes all the \"cells\" continuous. This construction method makes CW complexes especially useful for studying properties of spaces through homotopy theory because they are constructed inductively from simpler pieces. ",
