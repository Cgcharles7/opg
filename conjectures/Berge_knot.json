  "summary": "A Berge knot is a specific class of knots in the 3-sphere (\\(S^{3}\\)) that are related to lens space surgeries. A key characteristic is that when a non-trivial Dehn surgery is performed along the knot, the resulting manifold is a lens space. They are also known as doubly primitive knots because they can be described as a simple closed curve on a genus 2 Heegaard surface that is primitive in each of the two handlebodies. ",
