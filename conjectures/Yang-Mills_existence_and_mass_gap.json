  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_existence_and_mass_gap",
  "rephrased": "Prove that a consistent quantum theory of gauge fields exists with particles having a minimum mass (mass gap) for certain types of symmetry groups (compact simple gauge groups).",
  "implication_form": "If G is a compact simple gauge group, then a non-trivial quantum Yang-Mills theory with a mass gap exists on R⁴.",
  "posed_by": "Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 70,
  "explained": "The Yang–Mills existence and mass gap problem requires proving the existence of a non-trivial quantum Yang–Mills theory on four-dimensional Euclidean space (R⁴) for any compact, simple gauge group G, along with the existence of a mass gap (i.e., a positive lower bound on the masses of all particles in the spectrum). This means demonstrating a mathematically rigorous foundation for the quantum field theories that describe the strong nuclear force, which currently rely on heuristic methods and lack a complete proof of existence and the explanation for the mass gap, which is crucial for understanding why these forces have a short range.",
