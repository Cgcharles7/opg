  "rephrased": "The conjecture states that all non-trivial zeros of certain complex functions called automorphic L-functions lie on a specific vertical line in the complex plane, known as the critical line.",
  "implication_form": "If all non-trivial zeros of all automorphic L-functions lie on the critical line, then certain mathematical structures are stable and predictable.",
  "posed_by": "Various mathematicians (as a generalization of Riemann's hypothesis)",
  "solved_by": "Unsolved",
  "year_originated": 1970,
  "explained": "The Grand Riemann Hypothesis is a conjecture in number theory that generalizes the Riemann Hypothesis. It states that all non-trivial zeros of all automorphic L-functions (L-functions associated with automorphic representations) lie on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2 in the complex plane, where s is a complex variable.",
