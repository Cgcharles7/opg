  "rephrased": "The Ulam sequence starts with 1 and 2. Each subsequent term is the smallest number that can be uniquely expressed as the sum of two distinct earlier terms in the sequence and is larger than all previous terms.",

  "explained": "The Ulam sequence is a mathematical sequence defined recursively. It begins with U1 = 1 and U2 = 2. Each subsequent term Un (for n > 2) is the smallest positive integer larger than all previous terms that can be expressed as the sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one way. This definition generates a specific sequence, sometimes referred to as the (1,2)-Ulam sequence. It is important to note that this is a definition generating a specific sequence, not necessarily a conjecture about its properties.",
