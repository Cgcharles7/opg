  "summary": "In mathematics, the Ulam numbers comprise an integer sequence devised by and named after StanisÅ‚aw Ulam, who introduced it in 1964.  The standard Ulam sequence (the (1, 2)-Ulam  sequence) starts with U1 = 1 and U2 = 2.  Then for n > 2, Un is defined to be the smallest integer that is the sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one way and larger than all earlier terms.",
