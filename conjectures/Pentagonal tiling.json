  "summary": "In geometry, a pentagonal tiling is a tiling of the plane where each individual piece is in the shape of a pentagon.\nA regular pentagonal tiling on the Euclidean plane is impossible because the internal angle of a regular pentagon, 108°, is not a divisor of 360°, the angle measure of a whole turn. However, regular pentagons can tile the hyperbolic plane with four pentagons around each  vertex (or more) and sphere with three pentagons; the latter produces a tiling that is topologically equivalent",
