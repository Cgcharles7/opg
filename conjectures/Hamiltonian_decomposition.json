  "name": "Hamiltonian decomposition",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_decomposition",
  "rephrased": "For certain graphs, it is possible to divide all the edges into sets, each forming a single cycle that visits every vertex exactly once (a Hamiltonian cycle).",
  "implication_form": "If a graph has a Hamiltonian decomposition, then its edges can be partitioned into Hamiltonian cycles.",
  "posed_by": "Attributed to Hamiltonian cycle concepts (named after William Rowan Hamilton), but no specific proposer for the decomposition conjecture is widely recognized.",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": "1970s or 1980s (estimated)",
  "explained": "A Hamiltonian decomposition refers to a specific concept in graph theory, not an open conjecture. It describes a partition of the edges of a graph (either undirected or directed) into Hamiltonian cycles. In the undirected case, this is equivalent to a 2-factorization (a decomposition into disjoint cycles covering all edges) where each factor (cycle) is connected. There is no specific mathematical statement (like 'the graph has a Hamiltonian decomposition') that is being conjectured here; the definition itself is the key point.",
