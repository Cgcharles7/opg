  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%E2%80%93Moon_problem",
  "rephrased": "Find the minimum number of colors needed to color all regions in two overlapping maps (like Earth and Moon) such that: (1) Each region in the first map has a unique corresponding region in the second map; (2) Corresponding regions must share the same color; (3) Adjacent regions within either map must have different colors.",
  "implication_form": "If two regions are adjacent (share a border) on either map, then they must be colored differently.",
  "posed_by": "Originator not definitively identified, associated with research on planar graph coloring (e.g., related to the four-color theorem)",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": "estimate: 1960s or 1970s",
  "explained": "The Earth–Moon problem is a conjecture in graph theory concerning the chromatic number of a specific type of graph called a biplanar graph. It asks for the minimum number of colors required to color a map consisting of regions on both the Earth and the Moon, where each Earth region has a corresponding colony on the Moon. The coloring must ensure that each region and its colony share the same color, and any two regions (on Earth or the Moon) that share a border must have different colors.",
