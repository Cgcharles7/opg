  "explained": "The Finite Lattice Representation Problem conjectures that every finite lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some finite algebra. This is a fundamental open question in universal algebra. While it is known that every finite lattice can be represented as an interval in the subgroup lattice of some finite group, this is distinct from being a congruence lattice. The general consensus among researchers is that the answer to the Finite Lattice Representation Problem is negative, meaning not every finite lattice is a congruence lattice of a finite algebra, though a formal proof remains elusive.",
