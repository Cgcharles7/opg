  "rephrased": "For an n x n matrix with non-negative entries summing to n, the function φ(X) = (product of row sums) + (product of column sums) - permanent(X) is maximized only when all entries are equal to 1/n.",
  "implication_form": "If X is an n x n matrix with non-negative entries summing to n, then φ(X) is maximized only if X is the matrix J_n with all entries 1/n.",

  "year_originated": 2023,
  "explained": "The Dittert conjecture, also known as the Dittert–Hajek conjecture, is a hypothesis in combinatorics. It states that for any n x n matrix X with non-negative entries summing to n, the function φ(X) defined as the product of all row sums (∏_{i=1}^n r_i) plus the product of all column sums (∏_{j=1}^n c_j) minus the permanent of X (per(X)), achieves its unique maximum value when X is the matrix J_n, where every entry is 1/n.",
