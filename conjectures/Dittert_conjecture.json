  "summary": "The Dittert conjecture, or Dittert–Hajek conjecture, is a mathematical hypothesis in combinatorics concerning the maximum achieved by a particular function \n  \n    \n      \n        ϕ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n of matrices with real, nonnegative entries satisfying a summation condition. The conjecture is due to Eric Dittert and (independently) Bruce Hajek.\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        [\n        \n          a\n          \n            i\n            j\n          \n       ",
