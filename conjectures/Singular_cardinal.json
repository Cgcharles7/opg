  "explained": "The Singular Cardinal Conjecture (SCC) is a significant hypothesis in set theory concerning the behavior of singular cardinals. It states that if \\( \\kappa \\) is a singular cardinal and \\( \\cf(\\kappa) = \\lambda \\) (the cofinality of \\( \\kappa \\) is \\( \\lambda \\)), then the SCH (singular cardinals hypothesis) holds for \\( \\kappa \\), i.e., \\( 2^{\\kappa} = \\kappa^{++} \\), where \\( \\kappa^{++} \\) is the second successor cardinal after \\( \\kappa \\). In other words, the power set of \\( \\kappa \\) has the same cardinality as the \\( \\aleph \\)-number immediately following the \\( \\aleph \\)-number of \\( \\kappa \\)'s cofinality. König's theorem shows that regular cardinals cannot be singular, but the conjecture addresses the gap for singular cardinals.",
