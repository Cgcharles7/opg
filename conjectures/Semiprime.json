  "summary": "In mathematics, a semiprime is a natural number that is the product of exactly two prime numbers. The two primes in the product may equal each other, so the semiprimes include the squares of prime numbers.\nBecause there are infinitely many prime numbers, there are also infinitely many semiprimes. Semiprimes are also called biprimes, since they include two primes, or second numbers, by analogy with how \"prime\" means \"first\".  Alternatively non-prime semiprimes are called almost-prime numbers, spe",
