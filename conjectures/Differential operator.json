  "summary": "In mathematics, a differential operator is an operator defined as a function of the differentiation operator. It is helpful, as a matter of notation first, to consider differentiation as an abstract operation that accepts a function and returns another function (in the style of a higher-order function in computer science).\nThis article considers mainly linear differential operators, which are the most common type. However, non-linear differential operators also exist, such as the Schwarzian deri",
