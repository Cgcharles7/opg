  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yau%27s_conjecture_on_the_first_eigenvalue",
  "rephrased": "Is the first eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a closed minimal hypersurface embedded in an (n+1)-dimensional sphere equal to n?",
  "implication_form": "If a closed embedded minimal hypersurface in S^{n+1} is minimal, then its first eigenvalue equals n.",
  "posed_by": "Shing-Tung Yau (1982)",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 42,
  "explained": "Yau's conjecture on the first eigenvalue states that for any embedded closed minimal hypersurface in the unit sphere S^{n+1}, the first eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator acting on smooth functions defined on that hypersurface is exactly n. This conjecture, proposed by Shing-Tung Yau in 1982, remains unsolved as of 2018.",
