  "name": "Gauss circle problem",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_circle_problem",
  "rephrased": "The problem asks how many points with integer coordinates lie inside a circle of radius r centered at the origin, and how the actual count differs from the circle's area (πr²).",
  "implication_form": "If r is a positive real number, then the difference between the number of lattice points inside the circle of radius r centered at the origin and the area πr² is bounded by some function of r (though the exact bound is still unknown).",
