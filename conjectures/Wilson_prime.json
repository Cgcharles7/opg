  "explained": "In number theory, a Wilson prime is defined as a prime number p that satisfies the condition where p squared divides the quantity (p-1)! + 1, with the factorial symbol '!' denoting the product of all positive integers up to (p-1). This condition is a stronger requirement than Wilson's Theorem, which states that (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p) for any prime p, but requires only divisibility by p, not p squared.",
