  "name": "Negami's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_cover",
  "rephrased": "A finite graph has a planar cover (a finite planar graph that maps onto it in a specific way) if and only if it can be embedded into the projective plane.",
  "implication_form": "If a graph can be embedded into the projective plane, then it has a planar cover.",
  "posed_by": "Seiya Negami",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 35,
  "explained": "Negami's conjecture states that a finite graph has a planar cover if and only if it can be embedded into the projective plane. A planar cover is a finite covering graph of the original graph that is itself planar. This conjecture proposes a deep equivalence between the existence of a planar covering and the projective planarity of a graph.",
