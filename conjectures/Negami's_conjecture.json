  "summary": "In graph theory, a planar cover of a finite graph G is a finite covering graph of G that is itself a planar graph. Every graph that can be embedded into the projective plane has a planar cover; an unsolved conjecture of  Seiya Negami states that these are the only graphs with planar covers.\nThe existence of a planar cover is a minor-closed graph property, and so can be characterized by finitely many forbidden minors, but the exact set of forbidden minors is not known. For the same reason, there ",
