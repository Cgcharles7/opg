  "summary": "The De Bruijn–Newman constant (\\(\\Lambda \\)) is a mathematical constant related to the zeros of a specific function \\(H(\\lambda ,z)\\), which is connected to the Riemann zeta function. It defines the threshold for when all zeros of the function \\(H\\) are real. A key implication is that the Riemann hypothesis—a major unsolved problem in mathematics—is equivalent to the statement that \\(\\Lambda \\le 0\\). ",
