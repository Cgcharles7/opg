  "summary": "In differential geometry and geometric analysis, the Ricci flow ( REE-chee, Italian: [ˈrittʃi]), sometimes also referred to as Hamilton's Ricci flow, is a certain partial differential equation for a Riemannian metric. It is often said to be analogous to the diffusion of heat and the heat equation, due to formal similarities in the mathematical structure of the equation. However, it is nonlinear and exhibits many phenomena not present in the study of the heat equation.\nThe Ricci flow, so named fo",
