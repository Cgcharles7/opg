  "summary": "In mathematics, given two groups, (G,∗) and (H, ·), a group homomorphism from (G,∗) to (H, ·) is a function h : G → H such that for all u and v in G it holds that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        h\n        (\n        u\n        ∗\n        v\n        )\n        =\n        h\n        (\n        u\n        )\n        ⋅\n        h\n        (\n        v\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h(u*v)=h(u)\\cdot h(v)}\n  \n\nwhere the group operation on the left side of the equation is that of G and on the right side that of H",
