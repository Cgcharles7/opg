  "summary": "The Cobordism Hypothesis states that a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) is completely determined by its value on a single point, making it analogous to how a homology theory is determined by its value on a point. It establishes a fundamental equivalence: the category of TQFTs is equivalent to the free symmetric monoidal category of cobordisms, where the behavior on the point is all that matters for the entire theory. This means that the algebraic data of a TQFT is entirely encoded by how it assigns a value to a single point. ",
  "head": "a fully extended \\(C\\)-valued topological quantum field theory (TQFT) defined on \\(n\\)-dimensional framed manifolds and all their lower-dimensional cobordisms (i.e., a symmetric monoidal \\((\\infty ,n)\\)-functor from the framed bordism category to a symmetric monoidal \\((\\infty ,n)\\)-category \\(C\\) with duals), ",
  "tail": "the TQFT is uniquely and entirely determined, up to isomorphism, by its value on a single point (a 0-dimensional manifold). ",
