  "rephrased": "A fully extended TQFT on framed n-manifolds is equivalent to the free symmetric monoidal n-category with duals.",
  "implication_form": "If a fully extended TQFT is defined on framed n-manifolds, then it is equivalent to the free symmetric monoidal n-category with duals.",
  "posed_by": "Lurie",
  "solved_by": "Lurie",
  "year_originated": 30,
  "explained": "The Cobordism Hypothesis (proven by Jacob Lurie) states that a fully extended C-valued topological quantum field theory (TQFT) defined on n-dimensional framed manifolds and all their lower-dimensional cobordisms (i.e., a symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-functor from the framed bordism category to a symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category C with duals) is completely determined by its value on a single point (a point in the base space). This means that the entire algebraic data of the TQFT is encoded by how it assigns data to that single point. The hypothesis establishes an equivalence between the category of such TQFTs and the free symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category with duals on a point.",
