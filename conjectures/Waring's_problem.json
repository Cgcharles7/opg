  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waring%27s_problem",
  "rephrased": "For any whole number exponent k, there exists some number s such that every natural number can be written as the sum of at most s perfect kth powers.",
  "implication_form": "If k is a positive integer, then there exists a positive integer s such that every natural number is the sum of at most s kth powers.",
  "posed_by": "Edward Waring",
  "solved_by": "David Hilbert",
  "year_originated": 248,
  "explained": "Waring's conjecture (now known as Waring's problem) states that for every integer power k ≥ 2, there exists a corresponding positive integer s (often denoted as g(k)) such that every natural number can be expressed as the sum of at most s perfect kth powers. In other words, for each k, there is a number s(k) such that the set of natural numbers is the union of s(k) copies of the set of kth powers of natural numbers.",
