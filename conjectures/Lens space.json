  "summary": "A lens space is an example of a topological space, considered in mathematics.  The term often refers to a specific class of 3-manifolds, but in general can be defined for higher dimensions.\nIn the 3-manifold case, a lens space can be visualized as the result of gluing two solid tori together by a homeomorphism of their boundaries.
