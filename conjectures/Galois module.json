  "summary": "In mathematics, a Galois module is a G-module, with G being the Galois group (named for Ã‰variste Galois) of some extension of fields. The term Galois representation is frequently used when the G-module is a vector space over a field or a free module over a ring in representation theory, but can also be used as a synonym for G-module. The study of Galois modules for extensions of local or global fields and their group cohomology is an important tool in number theory.",
