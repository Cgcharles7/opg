  "name": "Bloch窶適ato conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_residue_isomorphism_theorem",
  "rephrased": "The Bloch窶適ato conjecture predicts that the rate at which an L-function vanishes at a specific point (its order of vanishing) directly reflects the size of a related arithmetic object called the Bloch窶適ato Selmer group, measured by its rank.",
  "implication_form": "If an L-function satisfies certain conditions (like being associated to a pure geometric p-adic Galois representation), then the order of vanishing of the L-function at a specific point is equal to the rank of the corresponding Bloch窶適ato Selmer group.",
