  "name": "Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery%27s_pair_correlation_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The zeros of the Riemann zeta function (when normalized to have a unit average spacing) tend to behave statistically like the eigenvalues of a random Hermitian matrix from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE).",
  "implication_form": "If the zeros of the Riemann zeta function are normalized to have unit average spacing, then their two-point correlation function (pair correlation) approaches the sine-squared function correlation function of GUE eigenvalues as the height along the critical line goes to infinity.",
