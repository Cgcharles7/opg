  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery%27s_pair_correlation_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The zeros of the Riemann zeta function (when normalized to have a unit average spacing) tend to behave statistically like the eigenvalues of a random Hermitian matrix from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE).",
  "implication_form": "If the zeros of the Riemann zeta function are normalized to have unit average spacing, then their two-point correlation function (pair correlation) approaches the sine-squared function correlation function of GUE eigenvalues as the height along the critical line goes to infinity.",
  "posed_by": "Hugh Montgomery",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 51,
  "explained": "Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture states that the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line, when scaled, has a specific statistical correlation function. It suggests that the pair correlation function for these zeros is the same as that for the eigenvalues of a random Hermitian matrix in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). This implies a \"repulsion\" effect, where zeros are not found clumped together but are, on average, spaced out from each other. ",
