  "rephrased": "A Hadamard manifold is a complete, simply connected space with a Riemannian metric that curves inward or straight (non-positive curvature everywhere), and such spaces are essentially the same as flat Euclidean space but with possible curvatures less than or equal to zero.",
  "implication_form": "If a Riemannian manifold is complete, simply connected, and has everywhere non-positive sectional curvature, then it is diffeomorphic to Euclidean space.",
  "posed_by": "Élie Cartan and Jacques Hadamard (the concept was developed by them, though the specific theorem is named after both)",
  "solved_by": "Élie Cartan and Jacques Hadamard (proved the Cartan-Hadamard theorem)",
  "year_originated": 120,
  "explained": "A Hadamard manifold, also known as a Cartan–Hadamard manifold, is a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold with everywhere non-positive sectional curvature. This definition describes a specific class of Riemannian manifolds, not a conjecture about their properties or existence. The Cartan–Hadamard theorem states that the exponential map is a global diffeomorphism from the tangent space at any point to the entire manifold, and that all geodesics are length-minimizing.",
