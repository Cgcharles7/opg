  "summary": "In mathematics, a Hadamard manifold, named after Jacques Hadamard — more often called a Cartan–Hadamard manifold, after Élie Cartan — is a Riemannian manifold \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        M\n        ,\n        g\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (M,g)}\n  \n that is complete and simply connected and has everywhere non-positive sectional curvature. By Cartan–Hadamard theorem all Cartan–Hadamard manifolds are diffeomorphic to the Euclidean space \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n        ",
