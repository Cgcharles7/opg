  "name": "Vaught conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaught_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The number of non-isomorphic countable models of a complete first-order theory in a countable language cannot be exactly ℵ1 unless the continuum hypothesis holds.",
  "implication_form": "If a complete first-order theory in a countable language has uncountably many countable models, then the number of such models must be equal to 2^ℵ0.",
  "posed_by": "Robert Lawson Vaught",
  "solved_by": "Morley solved it except for the case of ℵ1 models when the continuum hypothesis fails; Knight addressed the remaining case.",
  "year_originated": 63,
  "explained": "The Vaught conjecture, proposed by Robert Lawson Vaught in 1961, addresses the possible number of non-isomorphic countable models associated with a complete first-order theory using a countable language. It conjectures that the number of such countable models must be finite, countable (ℵ₀), or the cardinality of the continuum (2ℵ₀). This was later refined by Morley's theorem, which showed that the number is indeed one of these four possibilities, but the specific case of the number being ℵ₁ (when the continuum hypothesis is false) remains unresolved under the current axioms of set theory.",
