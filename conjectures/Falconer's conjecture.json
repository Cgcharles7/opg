  "summary": "In geometric measure theory, Falconer's conjecture, named after Kenneth Falconer, is an unsolved problem concerning the sets of Euclidean distances between points in compact \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  \n-dimensional spaces. Intuitively, it states that a set of points that is large in its Hausdorff dimension must determine a set of distances that is large in measure. More precisely, if \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  \n is a compact s",
