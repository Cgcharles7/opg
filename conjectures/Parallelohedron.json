  "summary": "In geometry, a parallelohedron or Fedorov polyhedron is a convex polyhedron that can be translated without rotations to fill Euclidean space, producing a honeycomb in which all copies of the polyhedron meet face-to-face. Evgraf Fedorov identified the five types of parallelohedron in 1885 in his studies of crystallographic systems. They are the cube, hexagonal prism, rhombic dodecahedron, elongated dodecahedron, and truncated octahedron.\nEach parallelohedron is centrally symmetric with symmetric ",
