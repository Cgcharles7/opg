  "summary": "In algebraic geometry, the problem of resolution of singularities asks whether every algebraic variety V has a resolution, which is a non-singular variety W with a proper birational map Wâ†’V. For varieties over fields of characteristic 0, this was proved by Heisuke Hironaka in 1964; while for varieties of dimension at least 4 over fields of characteristic p, it is an open problem.",
