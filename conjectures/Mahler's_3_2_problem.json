  "name": "Mahler's 3/2 problem",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahler%27s_3/2_problem",
  "rephrased": "A Z-number is a nonzero real number that remains in the interval [0, 0.5) for all its fractional parts when repeatedly multiplied by (3/2).",
  "implication_form": "If a nonzero real number x satisfies the condition that the fractional part of x * (3/2)^n is less than 0.5 for all positive integers n, then x is a Z-number.",
  "posed_by": "Kurt Mahler",
  "solved_by": "Jason Sondow",
  "year_originated": 70,
  "explained": "Mahler's 3/2 problem is a conjecture concerning the existence of 'Z-numbers'. A Z-number is defined as any nonzero real number x such that the fractional part of x multiplied by (3/2)^n is strictly less than 1/2 for every positive integer n. The conjecture, associated with mathematician Kurt Mahler, asks whether any such nonzero real numbers exist.",
