  "summary": "In mathematics, the Pompeiu problem is a conjecture in integral geometry, named for Dimitrie Pompeiu, who posed the problem in 1929, \nas follows.  Suppose f is a nonzero continuous function defined on a Euclidean space, and  K is a simply connected Lipschitz domain, so that the integral of f vanishes on every congruent copy of K.  Then the domain is a ball.\nA special case is Schiffer's conjecture.",
