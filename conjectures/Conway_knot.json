  "summary": "A Conway knot is an 11-crossing mathematical knot that famously challenged mathematicians for decades because it was not \"slice,\" meaning it could not be the boundary of a disk in four-dimensional space, despite fooling many mathematical \"invariants\" designed to test for this property. The knot, named after its discoverer John Horton Conway, was finally proven to be non-slice in 2020 by mathematician Lisa Piccirillo. ",
