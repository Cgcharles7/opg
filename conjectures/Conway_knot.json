  "explained": "A Conway knot is an 11-crossing mathematical knot that was once considered a major challenge in knot theory. Despite being a well-defined knot and fooling numerous mathematical invariants that should have detected it as non-slice (meaning it cannot be the boundary of a disk in four-dimensional space), for decades mathematicians believed it might be slice. The conjecture surrounding the Conway knot specifically concerned whether it was a slice knot or not, with the initial confusion arising because it evaded all known methods to prove its non-slice nature.",
