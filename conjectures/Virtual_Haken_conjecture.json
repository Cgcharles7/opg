  "summary": "In topology, an area of mathematics, the virtually Haken conjecture states that every compact, orientable, irreducible three-dimensional manifold with infinite fundamental group is virtually Haken. That is, it has a finite cover (a covering space with a finite-to-one covering map) that is a Haken manifold.\nAfter the proof of the geometrization conjecture by Perelman, the conjecture was only open for hyperbolic 3-manifolds.\nThe conjecture is usually attributed to Friedhelm Waldhausen in a paper f",
