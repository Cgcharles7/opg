  "summary": "In mathematics, the Ehrenpreis conjecture of Leon Ehrenpreis states that for any K greater than 1, any two closed Riemann surfaces of genus at least 2 have finite-degree covers which are K-quasiconformal: that is, the covers are arbitrarily close in the Teichm√ºller metric.\nA proof was announced by Jeremy Kahn and Vladimir Markovic in January 2011, using their proof of the Surface subgroup conjecture  and a newly developed \"good pants homology\" theory.  In June 2012, Kahn and Markovic were given ",
