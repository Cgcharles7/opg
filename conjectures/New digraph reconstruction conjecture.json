  "summary": "The reconstruction conjecture of Stanisław Ulam is one of the best-known open problems in graph theory. Using the terminology of Frank Harary it can be stated as follows: If G and H are two graphs on at least three vertices and ƒ is a bijection from V(G) to V(H) such that G\\{v} and H\\{ƒ(v)} are isomorphic for all vertices v in V(G), then G and H are isomorphic.\nIn 1964 Harary extended the reconstruction conjecture to directed graphs on at least five vertices as the so-called digraph reconstructi",
