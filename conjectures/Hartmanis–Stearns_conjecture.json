  "summary": "In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the Hartmanis–Stearns conjecture is an open problem named after Juris Hartmanis and Richard E. Stearns, who posed it in a 1965 paper that founded the field of computational complexity theory (earning them the 1993 ACM Turing Award).\nAn infinite word is said to be real-time computable when there exists a multitape Turing machine which (run without input) writes the successive letters of the word on its output tape, taking a bounded amount of time b",
