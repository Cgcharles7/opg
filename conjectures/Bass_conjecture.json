    "summary": "The Bass conjecture in algebraic geometry states that for a smooth, finite-type scheme \\(X\\) over a finite field \\(k\\), the algebraic \\(K\\)-theory groups \\(K_{n}(X)\\) for \\(n\\ge 0\\) are finitely generated. Proposed by Hyman Bass, this is a fundamental conjecture in algebraic \\(K\\)-theory, and related versions exist, such as the Bass-Quillen conjecture, which is a different but related statement about module theory over local rings.",
