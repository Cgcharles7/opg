  "explained": "The Hadamard conjecture states that an Hadamard matrix of order n exists if and only if n is a multiple of 4. An Hadamard matrix is a square matrix with entries +1 or -1, and rows that are pairwise orthogonal (i.e., any two distinct rows have a dot product of zero). This means that in any two distinct rows, the entries are +1 and -1 in exactly half of the columns (agreement) and mismatched in the other half (disagreement). The conjecture is about the existence of such matrices for every order that is a multiple of 4.",
