  "summary": "In the field of mathematics known as order theory, the 1/3–2/3 conjecture asserts that, if a set of items is being sorted by comparison, it is always possible to select the subsequent comparison in a way that will minimize the number of possible sorted orders by a factor of 2/3 or more, regardless of the comparisons that have already been made. To put it another way, there is a pair of elements x and y in every finite partially ordered set that is not completely ordered that have the condition that at least 1/3 and at most 2/3 of the linear extensions of the partial order place x sooner than y.",
