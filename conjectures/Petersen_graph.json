  "rephrased": "The Petersen graph is a 3-regular, non-planar graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges, serving as a fundamental counterexample in graph theory.",

  "explained": "The Petersen graph is a specific, well-defined undirected graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges, not a conjecture itself. It is characterized as a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3), bridgeless (no edges whose removal disconnects the graph), and non-3-edge-colorable (it cannot be properly edge-colored with three colors). It is named after Julius Petersen, who described it in 1898.",
