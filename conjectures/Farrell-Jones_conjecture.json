  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrell%E2%80%93Jones_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The algebraic K-theory and L-theory of a group's ring can be calculated by studying its virtually cyclic subgroups.",
  "implication_form": "If the assembly map associated with the virtually cyclic subgroups is an isomorphism, then the algebraic K-theory and L-theory of the group ring can be computed from the K- and L-theory of its virtually cyclic subgroups.",
