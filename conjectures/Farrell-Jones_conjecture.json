  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrell%E2%80%93Jones_conjecture",
  "summary": "The Farrell–Jones conjecture states that certain \"assembly maps\" are isomorphisms, which helps compute the algebraic K- and L-theory of group rings (\\(RG\\)) by using information from the group's subgroups. Essentially, it predicts that the complex K- and L-theory of a group ring can be calculated from the K- and L-theory of the group's subgroups, specifically the virtually cyclic subgroups. This conjecture has wide-ranging implications, as it implies other significant conjectures in topology and geometry, such as the Novikov and Borel conjectures. ",
  "head": "A group \\(G\\) has the property that its algebraic K-theory and L-theory can be computed using information from its virtually cyclic subgroups (i.e., the relevant \"assembly map\" is an isomorphism at the level of the classifying space for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups).", 
  "tail": "The complicated, actual algebraic K-theory and L-theory groups of the group ring \\(R[G]\\) (for a given ring \\(R\\), often the integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)) are isomorphic to these more computable groups. ",
