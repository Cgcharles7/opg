  "summary": "The Borel conjecture is a statement in geometric topology that asserts closed aspherical manifolds with isomorphic fundamental groups are homeomorphic. It is a statement of \"topological rigidity,\" meaning that a weaker algebraic equivalence (homotopy equivalence) implies a stronger topological equivalence (homeomorphism). In essence, it claims that a manifold is determined by its fundamental group, up to homeomorphism. ",
