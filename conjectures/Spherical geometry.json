  "summary": "Spherical geometry or spherics  (from Ancient Greek  σφαιρικά) is the geometry of the two-dimensional surface of a sphere or the n-dimensional surface of higher dimensional spheres.\nLong studied for its practical applications to astronomy, navigation, and geodesy, spherical geometry and the metrical tools of spherical trigonometry are in many respects analogous to Euclidean plane geometry and trigonometry, but also have some important differences.\nThe sphere can be studied either extrinsically a",
