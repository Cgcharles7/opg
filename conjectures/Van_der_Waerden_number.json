  "name": "Van der Waerden number",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waerden_number",
  "rephrased": "No matter how you color the integers from 1 to N using r different colors, if N is large enough (at least W(r,k)), you must find a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length k.",
  "implication_form": "If you color the integers from 1 to N using r colors, then there exists an arithmetic progression of length k consisting of integers all of the same color.",
  "posed_by": "Boudewijn de Rooij (alias Bart van der Waerden)",
  "solved_by": "partially solved (exact values known for small r and k, but general solution unknown)",
  "year_originated": 1928,
  "explained": "Van der Waerden's theorem states that for any positive integers r and k, there exists a positive integer N such that for any coloring of the integers {1, 2, ..., N} with r colors, there is a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length k. The van der Waerden number W(r, k) is defined as the smallest such N that guarantees this property regardless of the coloring.",
