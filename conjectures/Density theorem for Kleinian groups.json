  "summary": "In the mathematical theory of Kleinian groups, the density conjecture of Lipman Bers, Dennis Sullivan, and William Thurston, later proved independently by Namazi & Souto (2012) and Ohshika (2011), states that every finitely generated Kleinian group is an algebraic limit of geometrically finite Kleinian groups.",
