  "rephrased": null,
  "implication_form": "If x, y, and z are integers satisfying the equation x² + y² + z² = 3xyz, then each of x, y, and z is a Markov number.",
  "posed_by": "Andrey Markov",

  "explained": "A Markov number is a positive integer that appears in any solution to the Markov Diophantine equation x² + y² + z² = 3xyz, where x, y, z are positive integers. The solutions to this equation are generated recursively from the seed solution (1,1,1) using a greedy algorithm. The Markov numbers are all the positive integers that appear in any such solution triple.",
