  "summary": "In mathematics, the Suita conjecture is a conjecture related to the theory of the Riemann surface, the boundary behavior of conformal maps, the theory of Bergman kernel, and the theory of the L2 extension. The conjecture states the following:\n\nSuita (1972): Let R be an Riemann surface, which admits a nontrivial Green function \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          G\n          \n            R\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G_{R}}\n  \n.
