  "summary": "In mathematics, an algebraic cycle on an algebraic variety V is a formal linear combination of subvarieties of V.  These are the part of the algebraic topology of V that is directly accessible by algebraic methods.  Understanding the algebraic cycles on a variety can give profound insights into the structure of the variety.\nThe most trivial case is codimension zero cycles, which are linear combinations of the irreducible components of the variety.  The first non-trivial case is of codimension on",
