  "summary": "In mathematics, Lafforgue's theorem, due to Laurent Lafforgue, completes the Langlands program for general linear groups over algebraic function fields, by giving a correspondence between automorphic forms on these groups and representations of Galois groups. \nThe Langlands conjectures were introduced by Langlands (1967, 1970) and  describe a correspondence between representations of the Weil group of an algebraic function field and representations of algebraic groups over the function field, ge",
