  "name": "Ehrhart's volume conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrhart%27s_volume_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "If a convex body has its center of mass at the origin and contains no other lattice points inside, then its volume must be at most \\((n+1)^n / n!\\).",
  "implication_form": "If a convex body has its barycenter at the origin and contains only the origin as an interior lattice point, then its volume is less than or equal to \\((n+1)^n / n!\\).",
  "posed_by": "Ehrhart",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 60,
  "explained": "Ehrhart's volume conjecture states that for an n-dimensional convex body K ⊂ ℝⁿ with its barycenter at the origin, if K contains no other lattice points besides the origin in its interior, then the volume of K must satisfy vol(K) ≤ (n+1)ⁿ / n!. This conjecture provides an upper bound on the volume under the specified conditions.",
