  "summary": "In the geometry of numbers, Ehrhart's volume conjecture gives an upper bound on the volume of a convex body containing only one lattice point in its interior.  It is a kind of converse to Minkowski's theorem, which guarantees that a centrally symmetric convex body \n  \n    \n      \n        K\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K}\n  \n must contain a lattice point as soon as its volume exceeds \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle",
