  "name": "Nagata's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagata%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The automorphism defined by Nagata in the ring of polynomials in three variables is wild.",
  "implication_form": "It is not possible to rephrase the conjecture in the form 'If P, then Q' meaningfully.",
  "posed_by": "M. Nagata",
  "solved_by": "Ualbai U. Umirbaev and Ivan P. Shestakov",
  "year_originated": 52,
  "explained": "Nagata's conjecture (proposed by Masayoshi Nagata in 1972) states that the specific automorphism ϕ of the polynomial ring k[x,y,z] defined by ϕ(x) = x − 2Δy − (Δ²/z) * (some expression involving y and z), ϕ(y) = y, and ϕ(z) = z is a wild automorphism. This means that it cannot be expressed as a composition of elementary automorphisms. The conjecture was later proved true by Ualbai U. Umirbaev and Ivan P. Shestakov in 2004.",
