  "summary": "A congruent number is a positive integer that is the area of a right-angled triangle with sides of rational length. For example, the number 6 is congruent because it is the area of a 3-4-5 right triangle (\\(A=\\frac{1}{2}\\times 3\\times 4=6\\)). Numbers like 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not congruent, while 5 is the smallest congruent number. ",
