  "explained": "Hedetni'tniemi's conjecture, proposed by Stephen T. Hedetniemi in 1966, addresses the chromatic number of the tensor product of two graphs. It claims that the chromatic number of the product graph G × H is exactly equal to the minimum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs G and H. In mathematical notation: χ(G × H) = min{χ(G), χ(H)}.",
