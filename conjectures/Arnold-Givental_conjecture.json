  "summary": "The Arnold conjecture is a statement in symplectic geometry that the number of fixed points of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on a closed symplectic manifold is bounded below by the minimal number of critical points of a smooth function on that manifold. The conjecture is a generalization of the Poincaré-Birkhoff theorem and has inspired much research, particularly in the development of Floer homology. While it has been proven in many cases, particularly when the manifold is a surface, the full conjecture is not true for all Hamiltonian homeomorphisms in higher dimensions. ",
