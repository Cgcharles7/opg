  "summary": "Büchi's problem is an open problem in number theory that asks if there is a positive integer \\(M\\) such that any sequence of \\(M\\) or more integer squares with a constant second difference of 2 must be squares of consecutive integers, specifically \\((x+n)^{2}\\) for some integer \\(x\\) and \\(n=1,2,...,M\\). In other words, it investigates if sequences of squares are restricted to the pattern of consecutive integers, or if other sequences can exist indefinitely. A positive answer implies that an infinite sequence of consecutive squares is impossible, and a negative answer would mean such sequences can exist. ",
  "head": "a sequence of \\(M\\) or more integers has the property that the second difference of their squares is a constant sequence of \\(2\\)",
  "tail": "There exists an integer \\(x\\) such that \\(n_{i}=x+i\\) for all \\(1\\le i\\le M\\)",
