  "summary": "The n squares issue, or Büchi's problem, is an unresolved problem in number theory that bears the name of Julius Richard Büchi, a Swiss mathematician. It inquires as to whether there is a positive integer M such that, for each integer x, every series of M or more integer squares whose second difference is constant and equal to 2 is inevitably a sequence of squares of the form $(x + i)^2$, where i = 1, 2,..., M,... The following is the equivalent of Büchi's problem, according to Douglas Hensley in 1983: Is there a positive integer M such that, for all integers x and a, the quantity $(x + n)^2 + a$ cannot be a square for more than M consecutive values of n, unless a = 0?",
