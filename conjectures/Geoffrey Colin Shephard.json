  "summary": "Geoffrey Colin Shephard (16 August 1927 - 3 August 2016) was a British mathematician who worked on convex geometry and reflection groups. He asked Shephard's problem on the volumes of projected convex bodies, posed another problem on polyhedral nets, proved the Shephardâ€“Todd theorem in invariant theory of finite groups, began the study of complex polytopes, and classified the complex reflection groups.\nShephard earned his Ph.D. in 1954 from Queens' College, Cambridge, under the supervision of J.",
