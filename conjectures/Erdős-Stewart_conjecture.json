  "summary": "The Erdős–Stewart conjecture, solved by Florian Luca in 2001, concerned the Diophantine equation \\(n!+1=p^{a}q^{b}\\), where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are consecutive primes. The conjecture stated that the equation \\(n!+1=p^{a}q^{b}\\) has only finitely many solutions in positive integers \\(n,p,q,a,b\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are consecutive primes. ",
  "head": "\\(n!+1=p^{k}\\cdot m\\) where \\(p\\) is a prime number, \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are positive integers, and the greatest prime factor of \\(m\\) is less than or equal to a certain bound related to \\(p\\)", 
  "tail": "there are only a finite number of integer solutions \\((n,p,k,m)\\). ",
