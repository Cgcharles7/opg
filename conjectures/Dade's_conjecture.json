  "name": "Dade's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dade%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "When a finite group has a trivial p-core, the number of irreducible characters in a p-block with positive defect can be counted using characters from blocks of its p-local subgroups.",
  "implication_form": "If a finite group G has trivial p-core and B is a p-block of G with positive defect, then the number of irreducible characters in B is less than or equal to the sum over certain p-local subgroups H of the number of irreducible characters in blocks of H that are 'Dade correspondent' to B.",
