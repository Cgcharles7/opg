  "summary": "Dade's conjecture is a significant conjecture in finite group theory that relates the number of characters in a \"block\" of a finite group to the number of characters in blocks of its \"p-local subgroups\". Specifically, it posits a way to count and classify characters of a block by relating them to characters of blocks in certain subgroups. The conjecture was introduced by Everett C. Dade and implies other important conjectures, such as the Alperin-McKay conjecture. ",
  "head": "If a finite group \\(G\\) has a trivial normal \\(p\\)-subgroup (\\(O_{p}(G)=1\\)) and \\(B\\) is a \\(p\\)-block of \\(G\\) with positive defect", 
  "tail": "then the alternating sum of the number of characters with a fixed defect in related blocks of certain local subgroups is zero. ",
