  "summary": "Fermat's Last Theorem states that there are no positive integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) that can satisfy the equation \\(a^{n}+b^{n}=c^{n}\\) for any integer value of \\(n\\) greater than 2. While the equation has many integer solutions for \\(n=1\\) and \\(n=2\\) (like the Pythagorean triple \\(3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}\\)), it is impossible for any higher power. The theorem was proposed by Pierre de Fermat in 1637, but it remained unproven for over 350 years until Andrew Wiles provided a complete proof in 1994, which was published in 1995. ",
