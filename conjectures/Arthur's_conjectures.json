  "name": "Arthur's conjectures",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%27s_conjectures",
  "rephrased": "The conjectures map representations of reductive groups over local fields to automorphic representations via the Langlands program.",
  "implication_form": "If the conjectures hold, then the unitary representations predicted by the Langlands dual group exist and relate to automorphic forms.",
  "posed_by": "James Arthur",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 40,
  "explained": "Arthur's conjectures, formulated for reductive groups over global and local fields, propose a precise description of the automorphic representations contributing to the spectral decomposition of the relative trace formula derived from the Arthur-Selberg trace formula. They predict that these representations are deeply controlled by the Langlands dual group and its conjugacy classes, providing a framework to relate automorphic representations to Galois representations and vice versa, thereby extending the global Langlands program.",
