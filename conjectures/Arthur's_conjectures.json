  "summary": "In mathematics, the Arthur conjectures refer to a set of conjectures proposed by James Arthur in 1989. These conjectures pertain to the properties of automorphic representations of reductive groups over adele rings and the unitary representations of reductive groups over local fields. Arthur’s work, which was motivated by the Arthur–Selberg trace formula, suggests a framework for understanding complex relationships in these areas.\nArthur's conjectures have implications for other mathematical the",
