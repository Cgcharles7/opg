  "summary": "The Fontaine–Mazur conjecture proposes that \"purely arithmetic\" \\(p\\)-adic representations of a number field's Galois group must come from algebraic geometry, such as the étale cohomology of varieties. In simpler terms, it conjectures that any \\(p\\)-adic Galois representation that is unramified outside a finite set of primes and \"potentially semi-stable\" arises from the geometry of an algebraic variety. The conjecture also includes a related statement that there are no infinite unramified extensions of a number field whose Galois group is a pro-\\(p\\) group. ",
  "head": "Conditions for the Galois representation Almost everywhere unramified: The representation is unramified outside a finite set of primes. Potentially semi-stable at p: Its restriction to the decomposition group at a prime \\(p\\) is potentially semi-stable. This is now understood to be equivalent to being de Rham at \\(p\\). ",
  "tail": "Conclusion from algebraic geometry Comes from geometry: The representation is a subquotient of the \\(\\ell \\)-adic cohomology of some algebraic variety over the number field (up to a Tate twist). ",
