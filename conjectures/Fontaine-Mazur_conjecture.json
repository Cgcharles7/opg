  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontaine%E2%80%93Mazur_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The Fontaine–Mazur conjecture states that any p-adic Galois representation that is almost entirely unramified (only ramified at finitely many primes) and behaves well at p-adic primes (specifically, is potentially semi-stable) must originate from the geometric properties of some algebraic variety.",
  "implication_form": "If a p-adic representation of a number field's Galois group is almost everywhere unramified and potentially semi-stable, then it arises from the étale cohomology of some algebraic variety.",
  "posed_by": "Jean-Marc Fontaine and Jean-Marc Messing (commonly attributed to Fontaine and Mazur, though Mazur is sometimes mentioned).",
  "solved_by": "Unsolved",
  "year_originated": 30,
  "explained": "The Fontaine–Mazur conjecture consists of two main parts concerning p-adic Galois representations and number fields. First, it states that a p-adic representation of the absolute Galois group of a number field arises from algebraic geometry (e.g., étale cohomology) if and only if it is almost everywhere unramified and potentially semi-stable at p (equivalent to de Rham at p). Second, it conjectures that a number field has no infinite unramified pro-p extension for any prime p.",
