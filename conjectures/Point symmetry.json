  "summary": "In geometry, a point reflection (also called a point inversion or central inversion) is a geometric transformation of affine space in which every point is reflected across a designated inversion center, which remains fixed. In Euclidean or pseudo-Euclidean spaces, a point reflection is an isometry (preserves distance). In the Euclidean plane, a point reflection is the same as a half-turn rotation (180° or π radians), while in three-dimensional Euclidean space a point reflection is an improper ro",
