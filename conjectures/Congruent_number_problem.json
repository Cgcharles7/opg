  "summary": "The congruent number problem asks which positive integers are the area of a right triangle with rational sides. A number \\(n\\) is a \"congruent number\" if there exist rational numbers \\(a,b,c\\) such that \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}ab=n\\). For example, the number \\(6\\) is congruent because it is the area of a right triangle with sides \\(3,4,\\) and \\(5\\) (\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\times 3\\times 4=6\\)). What the problem asks Given a positive integer \\(n\\), is there a right triangle with rational side lengths whose area is exactly \\(n\\)?The problem is to find a definitive way to determine if a given integer \\(n\\) is a congruent number. ",
  "head": "The L-function of the associated elliptic curve \\(E_{n}:y^{2}=x^{3}-n^{2}x\\) has an analytic rank of zero (L(E_n, 1) \\(\\ne \\) 0).",
  "tail": "The only rational points on the elliptic curve \\(E_{n}\\) are the torsion points (those with \\(y=0\\), specifically \\((0,0)\\), \\((n,0)\\), and \\((-n,0)\\)), meaning the curve has an algebraic rank of zero. ",
