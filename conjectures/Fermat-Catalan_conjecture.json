  "summary": "The Fermat–Catalan conjecture is a mathematical statement that the equation \\(a^{m}+b^{n}=c^{k}\\) has only a finite number of solutions in positive coprime integers \\(a,b,c\\) and positive integers \\(m,n,k\\) that satisfy the inequality \\(\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{k}<1\\). It is a generalization of both Fermat's Last Theorem and Catalan's conjecture. ",
  "head": "\\(a,b,c\\) are positive coprime integers, \\(m,n,k\\) are positive integers, and the equation \\(a^{m}+b^{n}=c^{k}\\) holds, with the condition \\(\\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{k}<1\\).", 
  "tail": "There are only a finite number of solutions \\((a^{m},b^{n},c^{k})\\) that satisfy these conditions. ",
