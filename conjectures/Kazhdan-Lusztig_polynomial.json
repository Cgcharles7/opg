  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazhdan%E2%80%93Lusztig_polynomial",
  "rephrased": "The Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials are a family of polynomials indexed by pairs of elements in a Coxeter group (like a Weyl group), defined to satisfy specific recursive properties related to the group's structure.",
  "implication_form": "It is not possible to rephrase the definition of the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials as an 'If P, then Q' statement, as they are defined by their properties rather than being a statement that implies a consequence.",
