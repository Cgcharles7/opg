  "summary": "In mathematics, a real number is said to be simply normal in an integer base b if its infinite sequence of digits is distributed uniformly in the sense that each of the b digit values has the same natural density 1/b. A number is said to be normal in base b if, for every positive integer n, all possible strings n digits long have density bâˆ’n.\nIntuitively, a number being simply normal means that no digit occurs more frequently than any other. If a number is normal, no finite combination of digits",
