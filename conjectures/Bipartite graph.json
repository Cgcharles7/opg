  "summary": "In the mathematical field of graph theory, a bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets \n  \n    \n      \n        U\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle U}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n  \n, that is, every edge connects a vertex in \n  \n    \n      \n        U\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle U}\n  \n to one in \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n  \n.
