  "summary": "The Erdős–Graham problem refers to a class of problems related to Egyptian fractions, specifically the conjecture that if the integers greater than one are partitioned into a finite number of sets (Ramsey Theory), then at least one of those sets must contain a finite subset whose reciprocals sum to 1 (\\(1/x_{1}+1/x_{2}+...+1/x_{n}=1\\)). A related density version of the problem conjectures that any set of positive asymptotic density must also contain such a subset. The original coloring conjecture has been proven, with a proof by E. S. Croot, and the density version is also a major topic of research. ",
  "head": "The set of all integers greater than one is partitioned into a finite number of subsets (or \"colored\" with a finite number of colors). ", 
  "tail": "At least one of these subsets contains a finite group of distinct integers whose reciprocals sum exactly to one (an Egyptian fraction representation of unity). ",
