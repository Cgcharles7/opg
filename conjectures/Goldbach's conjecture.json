  "summary": "Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.\nThe conjecture has been shown to hold for all integers less than 4Ã—1018, but remains unproven despite considerable effort.",
