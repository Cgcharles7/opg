  "summary": "In algebraic geometry, flips  and  flops are  codimension-2 surgery operations arising in the minimal model program, given by blowing up along a relative canonical ring.  In dimension 3 flips are used to construct minimal models, and any two birationally equivalent  minimal models are connected by a sequence of flops. It is conjectured that the same is true in higher dimensions.",
