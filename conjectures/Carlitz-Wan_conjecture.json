  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlitz%E2%80%93Wan_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "A polynomial cannot be a permutation polynomial (which rearranges the elements of a finite field) of degree d over a finite field with q elements if the greatest common divisor of d and q-1 is greater than 1.",
  "implication_form": "If a polynomial has degree d over a finite field with q elements and the greatest common divisor of d and q-1 is greater than 1, then it cannot be a permutation polynomial.",
