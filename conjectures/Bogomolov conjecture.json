  "summary": "In mathematics, the Bogomolov conjecture is a conjecture, named after Fedor Bogomolov, in arithmetic geometry about algebraic curves that generalizes the Maninâ€“Mumford conjecture in arithmetic geometry.\nThe conjecture was proven by Emmanuel Ullmo and Shou-Wu Zhang in 1998 using Arakelov theory. A further generalization to general abelian varieties was also proved by Zhang in 1998.",
