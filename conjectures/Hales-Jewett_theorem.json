  "rephrased": "For any number of colors and any dimension, there is a size such that any coloring of the points in that high-dimensional grid with the colors will contain a monochromatic combinatorial line.",
  "implication_form": "If all points in a sufficiently high-dimensional grid are colored with c colors, then there exists a monochromatic combinatorial line.",

  "explained": "The Hales–Jewett theorem states that for any positive integers n and c, there exists a positive integer H (depending only on n and c) such that any coloring of the cells in the H-dimensional grid [n]^H (where [n] = {1,2,...,n}) with c colors must contain at least one monochromatic combinatorial line. A combinatorial line in this context is a set of points that are aligned along a row, column, file (in the combinatorial sense), or diagonal within the grid space.",
