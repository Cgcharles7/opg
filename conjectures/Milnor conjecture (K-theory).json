  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnor_conjecture_(K-theory)",
  "summary": "In mathematics, the Milnor conjecture was a proposal by John Milnor (1970) of a description of the Milnor K-theory (mod 2) of a general field F with characteristic different from 2, by means of the Galois (or equivalently Ã©tale) cohomology of F with coefficients in Z/2Z. It was proved by Vladimir Voevodsky (1996, 2003a, 2003b).",
