  "summary": "In mathematics, more specifically in the field of analytic number theory, a Landauâ€“Siegel zero or simply Siegel zero, also known as an exceptional zero, named after Edmund Landau and Carl Ludwig Siegel, is a type of potential counterexample to the generalized Riemann hypothesis, on the zeros of Dirichlet L-functions associated to quadratic number fields. Roughly speaking, these are possible zeros very near (in a quantifiable sense) to \n  \n    \n      \n        s\n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n   ",
