  "name": "Kahn–Kalai conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahn%E2%80%93Kalai_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The actual threshold for a property in random graphs is close to the expectation threshold.",
  "implication_form": "If the expectation threshold is E, then the actual threshold is close to E.",
  "posed_by": "Jeff Kahn and Gil Kalai",
  "solved_by": "Jinyoung Park and Huy Tuan Pham",
  "year_originated": 18,
  "explained": "The Kahn–Kalai conjecture states that for any increasing property (like a graph having a certain structure), the \"true threshold\" for its emergence is close to the \"expectation threshold,\" which is easier to calculate. Specifically, the conjecture posits a logarithmic relationship between the two, meaning their gap is at most a universal constant multiplied by the logarithm of the system's size. It was famously proven by Jinyoung Park and Huy Tuan Pham in 2022, settling a major problem in probabilistic combinatorics. ",
