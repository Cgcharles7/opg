  "summary": "In the mathematical theory of minimal surfaces, the double bubble theorem states that the shape that encloses and separates two given volumes and has the minimum possible surface area is a standard double bubble: three spherical surfaces meeting at angles of 120Â° on a common circle. The double bubble theorem was formulated and thought to be true in the 19th century, and became a \"serious focus of research\" by 1989, but was not proven until 2002.\nThe proof combines multiple ingredients.
