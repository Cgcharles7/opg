  "name": "Poincaré conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "A finite, simply connected 3D shape with no holes is like a sphere.",
  "implication_form": "If a finite, simply connected 3D shape has all loops contractible, then it is a 3-sphere.",
  "posed_by": "Henri Poincaré",
  "solved_by": "Grigori Perelov",
  "year_originated": 120,
  "explained": "The Poincaré conjecture, now proven as a theorem, states that any three-dimensional manifold that is compact, simply connected (meaning every loop can be continuously contracted to a point), and has no holes (i.e., its fundamental group is trivial) is topologically equivalent to the three-dimensional sphere (3-sphere). In simpler terms, it suggests that the only 'bounded' three-dimensional space that is 'sphere-like' (without any handles or holes) is actually a sphere itself.",
