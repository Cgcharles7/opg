  "explained": "Parshin's conjecture (also referred to as the Beilinson–Parshin conjecture) is a statement in algebraic geometry concerning the vanishing of certain higher algebraic K-groups for smooth projective varieties defined over finite fields. The conjecture asserts that for any such variety X and for all integers i > 0, the tensor product of the i-th algebraic K-group of X with the rational numbers Q is trivial, i.e., Kᵢ(X) ⊗ ℚ = 0.",
