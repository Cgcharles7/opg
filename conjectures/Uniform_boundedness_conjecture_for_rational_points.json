  "name": "Uniform boundedness conjecture for rational points",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_boundedness_conjecture_for_rational_points",
  "rephrased": "For curves of fixed genus at least 2 defined over a fixed number field, the number of rational points is uniformly bounded.",
  "implication_form": "If a curve has genus at least 2 and is defined over a fixed number field, then the number of its rational points is bounded by a constant depending only on the number field and the genus.",
  "posed_by": "Boris Manin (among others)",
  "solved_by": "Unsolved",
  "year_originated": 50,
  "explained": "The Uniform Boundedness Conjecture for Rational Points states that for a fixed number field K and a fixed genus g ≥ 2, there exists a positive integer N(K, g) (depending only on K and g) such that every smooth, projective, geometrically connected curve of genus g defined over K that has at least one K-rational point has at most N(K, g) K-rational points. In other words, the number of rational points on such curves with a rational point is uniformly bounded across all curves of that genus over the fixed number field.",
