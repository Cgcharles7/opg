  "summary": "In mathematics, the Farrell–Jones conjecture, named after F. Thomas Farrell and Lowell E. Jones, states that certain assembly maps are isomorphisms. These maps are given as certain homomorphisms.\nThe motivation is the interest in the target of the assembly maps; this may be, for instance, the algebraic K-theory of a group ring\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        (\n        R\n        G\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{n}(RG)}\n  \n\nor ",
