  "name": "Lander, Parkin, and Selfridge conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lander,_Parkin,_and_Selfridge_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "If two different sets of k-th powers have the same sum, then the total number of terms in these two sets combined must be at least k.",
  "implication_form": "If the sum of some k-th powers equals the sum of other k-th powers, then the total number of terms in both sets must be at least k.",
  "posed_by": "Lander, Parkin, and Selfridge",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 1960,
  "explained": "The Lander, Parkin, and Selfridge conjecture states that if the sum of m terms, each a k-th power, equals the sum of n terms, each a k-th power, then the total number of terms (m + n) must be at least k.",
