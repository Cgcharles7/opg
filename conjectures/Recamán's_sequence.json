  "explained": "Recamán's sequence is a well-known sequence defined recursively. It starts with a₀ = 0. For n > 0, aₙ is calculated as follows: if aₙ₋₁ - n is positive and not already present in the sequence, then aₙ = aₙ₋₁ - n; otherwise, aₙ = aₙ₋₁ + n. This sequence is known for its complex structure and fractal-like properties, despite its simple recursive definition.",
