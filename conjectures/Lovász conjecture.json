  "summary": "In graph theory, the Lovász conjecture (1969) is a classical problem on Hamiltonian paths in graphs. It says:\n\nEvery finite connected vertex-transitive graph contains a Hamiltonian path.\nOriginally László Lovász stated the problem in the opposite way, but\nthis version became standard.
