  "summary": "In graph theory, the Lovász conjecture (1969) is a classical problem on Hamiltonian paths in graphs. It says:\n\nEvery finite connected vertex-transitive graph contains a Hamiltonian path.\nOriginally László Lovász stated the problem in the opposite way, but\nthis version became standard.  In 1996, László Babai published a conjecture sharply contradicting this conjecture, but both conjectures remain widely open. It is not even known if a single counterexample would necessarily lead to a series of co",
