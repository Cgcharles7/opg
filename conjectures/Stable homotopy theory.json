  "summary": "In mathematics, stable homotopy theory is the part of homotopy theory (and thus algebraic topology) concerned with all structure and phenomena that remain after sufficiently many applications of the suspension functor.  A founding result was the Freudenthal suspension theorem, which states that given any pointed space \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n, the homotopy groups \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Ï€\n          \n            n\n            +\n            k\n     ",
