Thus, a Banach space is a vector space with a metric that allows the computation of vector length and distance between vectors and is complete in the sense that a Cauchy sequence of vectors always converges to a well-defined limit that is within the space.\nBanach spaces are named after the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach, who introduced this concept a",
