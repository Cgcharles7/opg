  "summary": "Euler's totient function, denoted by \\(\\phi (n)\\), counts the positive integers up to a given integer \\(n\\) that are relatively prime to \\(n\\). In other words, it is the number of integers \\(m\\) between \\(1\\) and \\(n\\) (inclusive) such that the greatest common divisor of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) is \\(1\\). For example, \\(\\phi (15)=8\\) because the numbers \\(1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14\\) are all less than \\(15\\) and are coprime to \\(15\\).  ",
