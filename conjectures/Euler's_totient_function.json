  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function",
  "rephrased": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), gives the count of numbers from 1 to n that are coprime to n (share no common factors other than 1 with n).",
  "implication_form": "If n is prime, then φ(n) = n - 1.",
  "posed_by": "Leonhard Euler",
  "solved_by": "Leonhard Euler (defined it), solved various properties over time by multiple mathematicians",
  "year_originated": 300,
  "explained": "Euler's totient function, denoted by φ(n), is a function in number theory that counts the number of positive integers up to a given integer n that are coprime to n. Two integers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. For example, φ(15) = 8 because the integers 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14 are coprime to 15.",
