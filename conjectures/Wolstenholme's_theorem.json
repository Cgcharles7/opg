  "name": "Wolstenholme's theorem",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolstenholme%27s_theorem",
  "rephrased": "For any prime number p that is 5 or larger, the binomial coefficient C(2p-2, p-1) is divisible by p squared.",
  "implication_form": "If p is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, then C(2p-2, p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p²).",
  "posed_by": "Robert Fredrick Wolstenholme",
  "solved_by": "Unsolved (the forward direction was proven, but the converse is not generally established)",
  "year_originated": 1862,
  "explained": "Wolstenholme's theorem is a proven result in number theory, not a conjecture. It states that for any prime number p ≥ 5, the binomial coefficient C(2p-1, p-1) (read as '2p-1 choose p-1) satisfies the congruence C(2p-1, p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p²).",
