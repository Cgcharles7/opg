  "summary": "In the early 1990s, Noga Alon, Michael Saks, and Paul Seymour developed a conjecture that, if correct, would greatly expand the Graham–Pollak theorem: they postulated that at least k subgraphs are required whenever the edges of a graph with chromatic number k+1 are divided into complete bipartite subgraphs. Similarly, they postulate that at most k+1 colors can always be used to color edge-disjoint unions of k complete bipartite graphs. By creating families of graphs that are edge-disjoint unions of k complete bipartite graphs that require {\\displaystyle \\Omega (k^{6/5})} colors, Huang and Sudakov refuted the conjecture in 2012.[9] More significantly, up to the {\\displaystyle o(1)} term in the exponent, the number of colors can be as great as {\\displaystyle \\exp \\log ^{2-o(1)}k}.[10]",
