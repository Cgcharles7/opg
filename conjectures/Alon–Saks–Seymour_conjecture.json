  "summary": "In graph theory, the Graham–Pollak theorem states that the edges of an \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n-vertex complete graph cannot be partitioned into fewer than \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        −\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n-1}\n  \n complete bipartite graphs. It was first published by Ronald Graham and Henry O. Pollak in two papers in 1971 and 1972 (crediting Hans Witsenhausen for a key lemma), in connection with an application to telephone switchi",
