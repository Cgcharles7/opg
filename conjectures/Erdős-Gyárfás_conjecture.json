  "summary": "The Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture states that every graph with a minimum degree of at least three must contain a cycle whose length is a power of two (\\(2^{m}\\)). Proposed in 1995 by Paul Erdős and András Gyárfás, it is an unsolved problem in graph theory. The conjecture is still actively researched, and progress has been made on specific classes of graphs, such as those that are \"P10-free\" (without an induced path of length 10). ",
