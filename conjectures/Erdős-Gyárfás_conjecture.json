  "explained": "The Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture states that every finite graph with a minimum degree of at least three (δ(G) ≥ 3) must contain a cycle whose length is a power of two (i.e., a cycle of length 2ᵏ for some integer k ≥ 0). In logical terms, the conjecture can be restated as: If a graph has minimum degree at least three, then it contains a cycle of length a power of two.",
