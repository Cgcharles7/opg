  "summary": "The Baum–Connes conjecture proposes that an \"assembly map\" between the topological K-theory of a group's classifying space and the K-theory of its reduced C*-algebra is an isomorphism. This conjecture connects different areas of mathematics, such as geometry, topology, and operator algebra, and its truth has significant implications, including potentially proving older conjectures like the Novikov conjecture. The conjecture is known to be true for large classes of groups, such as amenable and hyperbolic groups, but it is not known if it holds for all discrete groups.",
