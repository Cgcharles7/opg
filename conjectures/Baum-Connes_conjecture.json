  "name": "Baum–Connes conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Connes_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The topological K-theory of a group's classifying space is isomorphic to the K-theory of its reduced C*-algebra via a specific map called the assembly map.",
  "implication_form": "Not applicable (the conjecture is an equality/isomorphism itself)",
  "posed_by": "H. Blumberg and G. Connes (or H. Baum and G. Connes)",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 30,
  "explained": "The Baum–Connes conjecture states that for any discrete group Γ, the assembly map \\( \\mu_Γ \\colon \\underset{\\underline{E}Γ}{K}^*(BΓ) \\to \\mathrm{K}\\text{\\textunderscore{as}}^*(C^*_\\mathrm{red}(Γ)) \\) is an isomorphism of abelian groups. Here, \\( \\underset{\\underline{E}Γ}{K}^*(BΓ) \\) denotes the topological K-theory of the classifying space \\( BΓ \\) (the space representing the classifying bundle for principal Γ-bundles), \\( C^*_\\mathrm{red}(Γ) \\) is the reduced group C*-algebra associated with Γ, and \\( \\mathrm{K}\\text{\\textunderscore{as}}^* \\) is the analytic K-theory (the K-theory of the C*-algebra). The assembly map is a fundamental map that connects the topological and analytic aspects of the group.",
