  "summary": "The Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem concerns the mathematical properties of solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, a system of partial differential equations that describe the motion of a fluid in space.  Solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations are used in many practical applications.  However, theoretical understanding of the solutions to these equations is incomplete.  In particular, solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations often include turbulence, which remains one of the ",
