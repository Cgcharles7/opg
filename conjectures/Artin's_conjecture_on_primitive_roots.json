  "summary": "A given integer a that is neither a square number nor −1 is a primitive root modulo an unlimited number of primes p, according to Artin's conjecture on primitive roots in number theory. These primes are also assigned an asymptotic density by the conjecture. Artin's constant or a reasonable multiple of it is equivalent to this conjectural density.<br><br>According to Helmut Hasse's diary, Emil Artin made the conjecture to him on September 27, 1927. As of 2025, the conjecture remains unsolved. In actuality, Artin's conjecture is not proven for any one value of a.",
