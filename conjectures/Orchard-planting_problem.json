  "rephrased": "What is the maximum number of lines containing exactly three points that can be achieved by arranging n points in the plane?",
  "implication_form": "If a configuration of n points in the plane is given, then the maximum number of lines containing exactly three points is less than some asymptotic bound involving n.",

  "explained": "The original orchard-planting problem (or tree-planting problem) is a question in combinatorial geometry. It asks for the maximum number of lines (termed 'k-point lines' or simply 'lines' when k=3) that can be formed by connecting at least k points in a set of n points in the plane, with the condition that no three collinear points are left out (i.e., every line with at least two points is counted if it has at least k points). Hallard T. Croft and Paul Erdős proved that for any fixed k, there exists a constant c_k > 0 such that the maximum number t_k(n) of k-point lines satisfies t_k(n) > c_k * n for sufficiently large n.",
