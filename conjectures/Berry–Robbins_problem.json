  "summary": "In mathematics, the Berry–Robbins problem asks whether there is a continuous map from configurations of n points in R3 to the flag manifold U(n)/Tn that is compatible with the action of the symmetric group on n points. It was posed by Berry and Robbins in 1997, and solved positively by Atiyah in 2000.",
