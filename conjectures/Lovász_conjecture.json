  "name": "Lovász conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lov%C3%A1sz_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Every finite, connected graph where all vertices are equivalent (vertex-transitive) contains a path that visits every vertex exactly once (a Hamiltonian path).",
  "implication_form": "If a graph is finite, connected, and vertex-transitive, then it has a Hamiltonian path.",
  "posed_by": "László Lovász",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 54,
  "explained": "The Lovász conjecture (1969), now standardly stated, asserts that every finite, connected graph that is vertex-transitive contains a Hamiltonian path. A Hamiltonian path visits each vertex exactly once. Although László Lovász originally posed the problem in the opposite form, the current formulation—that vertex-transitive graphs possess Hamiltonian paths—has become widely accepted and studied.",
