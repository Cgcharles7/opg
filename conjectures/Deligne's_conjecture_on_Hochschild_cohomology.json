  "summary": "Deligne's conjecture states that the Hochschild cochain complex of an associative algebra has the structure of an algebra over the little disks operad. This means that the cochain complex not only inherits a Gerstenhaber algebra structure (which is the homology of the little disks operad), but it has a corresponding action by the singular chains of the little disks operad itself. This conjecture, proven by various mathematicians including McClure, Smith, Kontsevich, and Tamarkin, connects algebraic structures to topology. ",
