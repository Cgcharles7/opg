  "summary": "Chern's conjecture for hypersurfaces in spheres, unsolved as of 2018, is a conjecture proposed by Chern in the field of differential geometry. It originates from the Chern's unanswered question:\n\nConsider closed minimal submanifolds \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          M\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M^{n}}\n  \n immersed in the unit sphere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          \n            n\n            +\n            m\n          \n        \n     ",
