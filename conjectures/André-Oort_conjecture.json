  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9%E2%80%93Oort_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "The Zariski closure of any set of special points in a Shimura variety is itself a special subvariety.",
  "implication_form": "If a subset of special points in a Shimura variety is sufficiently large or satisfies certain arithmetic conditions, then its Zariski closure is a special subvariety.",

  "year_originated": 30,
  "explained": "The André-Oort conjecture is a theorem in algebraic geometry that states that if a subvariety of a Shimura variety contains a Zariski-dense set of "special points," then that subvariety must itself be a special subvariety or a Shimura subvariety. Essentially, it describes how "special" points—those with high symmetry or specific properties—are distributed within these complex geometric spaces. The conjecture is a fundamental result in "unlikely intersections" theory and was proven in 2021. ",
