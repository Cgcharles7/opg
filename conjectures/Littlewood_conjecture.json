  "summary": "In mathematics, the Littlewood conjecture is an open problem in Diophantine approximation, proposed by J. E. Littlewood around 1930. It states that for any two real numbers \n  \n    \n      \n        α\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        β\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\beta }\n  \n,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          lim inf\n          \n            n\n            →\n            ∞\n          \n        \n         \n        n\n        \n        ‖\n        n\n        α\n        ",
