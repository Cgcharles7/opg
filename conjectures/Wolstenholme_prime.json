  "summary": "In number theory, a Wolstenholme prime is a special type of prime number satisfying a stronger version of Wolstenholme's theorem. Wolstenholme's theorem is a congruence relation satisfied by all prime numbers greater than 3. Wolstenholme primes are named after mathematician Joseph Wolstenholme, who first described this theorem in the 19th century.\nInterest in these primes first arose due to their connection with Fermat's Last Theorem. Wolstenholme primes are also related to other special classes",
