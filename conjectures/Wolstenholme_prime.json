  "rephrased": "A Wolstenholme prime is a prime number that satisfies a stronger condition related to binomial coefficients, specifically where certain binomial coefficients are congruent to 0 modulo p^3.",
  "implication_form": "If a prime p satisfies a stronger congruence condition involving binomial coefficients modulo p^3, then p is a Wolstenholme prime.",
  "posed_by": "Joseph Wolstenholme",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 150,
  "explained": "A Wolstenholme prime is a prime number p > 3 that satisfies the stronger condition of Wolstenholme's theorem. Specifically, it is a prime p such that the binomial coefficient C(p-1, (p-1)/2) is congruent to 0 modulo p^2. Equivalently, p is a Wolstenholme prime if the binomial coefficient C(p-1, k) is congruent to 0 modulo p^2 for all k not divisible by p, or if the Bernoulli number B_{p-1} is congruent to 0 modulo p^2.",
