  "rephrased": "A conjecture concerning the existence of convex polytopes with specific combinatorial types and symmetry groups.",
  "implication_form": "If certain combinatorial and symmetry conditions are met, then there exists a convex polytope realizing those conditions.",
  "posed_by": "Peter McMullen",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 1975,
  "explained": "The McMullen problem is an open problem in discrete geometry posed by Peter McMullen. It concerns the characterization of the combinatorial types of convex polytopes. The problem seeks to identify or classify all possible combinatorial structures (types) that can be realized as the face lattices of convex polytopes in a given dimension or with specific properties. While the precise formulation can vary, it typically involves finding necessary and sufficient conditions for a combinatorial object to be the face lattice of a convex polytope, or relating the combinatorial type to its geometric realization, such as through the normal fan or the set of facet-defining inequalities.",
