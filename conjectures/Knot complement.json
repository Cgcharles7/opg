  "summary": "In mathematics, the knot complement of a tame knot K is the space where the knot is not. If a knot is embedded in the 3-sphere, then the complement is the 3-sphere minus the space near the knot. To make this precise, suppose that K is a knot in a three-manifold M (most often, M is the  3-sphere).  Let N be a tubular neighborhood of K; so N is a solid torus.  The knot complement is then the complement of N,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          X\n          \n            K\n          \n        \n        ",
