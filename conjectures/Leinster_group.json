  "rephrased": "A finite group is a Leinster group if its order equals the sum of the orders of its proper normal subgroups.",

  "explained": "A Leinster group is a finite group G for which the order of G equals the sum of the orders of all its proper normal subgroups. Formally, if N(G) denotes the set of proper normal subgroups of G (excluding G itself but including the trivial subgroup), then |G| = σ(N(G)), where σ denotes the sum of the orders of the elements in the set.",
