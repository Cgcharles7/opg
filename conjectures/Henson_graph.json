  "rephrased": "The Henson graph Gi is an infinite, countable, homogeneous graph that avoids a specific i-clique but contains every finite graph that also avoids that i-clique.",
  "implication_form": "It is not possible to frame this as a standard 'If P, then Q' implication, as the original statement is more of a definition than a conjecture to be proven.",
  "posed_by": "C. Ward Henson",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 50,
  "explained": "The Henson graph H_i (or G_i) is a well-defined infinite graph, not a conjecture. It is the unique (up to isomorphism) countable homogeneous graph that omits a specific i-vertex clique (K_i) but contains every finite graph that does not contain a K_i as an induced subgraph. For example, the Henson graph H_3 is triangle-free and contains all finite triangle-free graphs.",
