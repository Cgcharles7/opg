  "summary": "In mathematics, the Simon problems (or Simon's problems) are a series of fifteen questions posed in the year 2000 by Barry Simon, an American mathematical physicist. Inspired by other collections of mathematical problems and open conjectures, such as the famous list by David Hilbert, the Simon problems concern quantum operators. Eight of the problems pertain to anomalous spectral behavior of Schr√∂dinger operators, and five concern operators that incorporate the Coulomb potential. \nIn 2014, Artur",
