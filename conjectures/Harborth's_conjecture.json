  "name": "Harborth's conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harborth%27s_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Every planar graph can be drawn with straight-line edges where each edge has a whole number length (integer).",
  "implication_form": "If a graph is planar, then it can be drawn with straight edges of integer lengths.",
  "posed_by": "Heiko Harborth",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": 55,
  "explained": "Harborth's Conjecture states that every planar graph admits a straight-line embedding (a drawing with vertices at points and edges as straight line segments) in the plane such that all edge lengths are integers.",
