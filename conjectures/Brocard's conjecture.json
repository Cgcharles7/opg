  "summary": "== Introduction ==\nIn number theory, Brocard's conjecture is the conjecture that there are at least four prime numbers between (pn)2 and (pn+1)2, where pn is the nth prime number, for every n ≥ 2.  The conjecture is named after Henri Brocard.  It is widely believed that this conjecture is true. However, it remains unproven as of 2025. Legendre's conjecture that there is a prime between consecutive integer squares directly implies that there are at least two primes between prime squares for pn ≥ ",
