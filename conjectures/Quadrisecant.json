  "summary": "In geometry, a quadrisecant or quadrisecant line of a space curve is a line that passes through four points of the curve. This is the largest possible number of intersections that a generic space curve can have with a line, and for such curves the quadrisecants form a discrete set of lines. Quadrisecants have been studied for curves of several types:\n\nKnots and links in knot theory, when nontrivial, always have quadrisecants, and the existence and number of quadrisecants has been studied in conn",
