  "summary": "The Bunyakovsky conjecture is a proposal in number theory that states a polynomial with integer coefficients will produce infinitely many prime numbers if it meets three conditions: the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial is irreducible over the rationals, and there is no common factor greater than 1 for all values of the polynomial as the input varies. In simpler terms, the conjecture is a generalization of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions to polynomials of higher degree. ",
  "head": "\\(f(x)\\) is a non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients that satisfies the following three conditions: The leading coefficient of \\(f(x)\\) is positive.\\(f(x)\\) is irreducible over the integers (it cannot be factored into two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients).The values \\(f(n)\\) for positive integers \\(n\\) have no common prime factor greater than 1 (equivalently, the greatest common divisor of all values \\(f(n)\\) for \\(n\\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}\\) is 1). ",
