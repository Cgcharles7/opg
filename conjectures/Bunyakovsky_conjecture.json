  "summary": "A polynomial {\displaystyle f(x)} in one variable with integer coefficients must satisfy the Bunyakovsky conjecture (also known as the Bouniakowsky conjecture) in order to yield an endless number of prime values in the series {\displaystyle f(1),f(2),f(3),\ldots.} For {\displaystyle f(x)} to possess the intended prime-producing feature, the following three prerequisites must be met:<br><br>For all the infinitely many values {\displaystyle f(1),f(2),f(3),\ldots }, there is no common factor, the leading coefficient is positive, and the polynomial is irreducible over rationals (and integers). (Specifically, {\displaystyle f(x)}'s coefficients ought to be comparatively prime. The values of f(n) do not have to be pairwise relatively prime.)<br><br>These requirements are adequate, according to Bunyakovsky's conjecture: {\displaystyle f(n)} is prime for an unlimited number of positive integers {\displaystyle n} if {\displaystyle f(x)} fulfills (1)–(3).",
