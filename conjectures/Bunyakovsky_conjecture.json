  "name": "Bunyakovsky conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyakovsky_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "A certain type of polynomial (one that is irreducible, has positive leading coefficient, and doesn't share a common factor greater than 1 with all its integer outputs) will always produce an infinite number of prime numbers when evaluated at positive integers.",
  "implication_form": "If a non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients is irreducible over the integers, has a positive leading coefficient, and the values it takes at positive integers have no common prime divisor, then it takes on infinitely many prime values.",
  "posed_by": "Sergei Bunyakovsky",
  "solved_by": "unsolved",
  "year_originated": "over 130 years",
  "explained": "The Bunyakovsky conjecture is a hypothesis in number theory proposing that a non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients will produce infinitely many prime numbers if it satisfies three conditions: its leading coefficient is positive, it is irreducible over the integers (cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients), and the greatest common divisor of all its integer values is 1.",
