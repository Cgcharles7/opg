  "summary": "The Ehrenpreis conjecture, proven by Jeremy Kahn and Vladimir Markovic, states that any two closed Riemann surfaces of genus at least 2 have finite-degree covers that are geometrically close, meaning there exists a diffeomorphism between them with small distortion. This was a long-standing problem in mathematics that establishes a strong connection between any two such surfaces by showing their finite covers can be made arbitrarily close in their geometric properties. ",
  "head": "\\(S\\) and \\(T\\) are any two closed Riemann surfaces of genus at least 2", 
  "tail": "for any \\(K>1\\), one can find finite-degree covers \\(S^{\\prime }\\) and \\(T^{\\prime }\\) of \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) respectively, such that there exists a \\(K\\)-quasiconformal map between \\(S^{\\prime }\\) and \\(T^{\\prime }\\). ",
