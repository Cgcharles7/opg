  "name": "Ehrenpreis conjecture",
  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenpreis_conjecture",
  "rephrased": "Any two closed surfaces with genus at least 2 have finite covers that are geometrically very similar, differing only slightly in distortion.",
  "implication_form": "If S and T are any two closed Riemann surfaces of genus at least 2, then there exist finite-degree covers of S and T and a diffeomorphism between these covers with small distortion.",
  "posed_by": "Ehrenpreis (attributed to him, exact proposer not specified in the query)",
  "solved_by": "Jeremy Kahn and Vladimir Markovic",
  "year_originated": "around 60 years ago (estimated based on context)",
  "explained": "The Ehrenpreis conjecture states that any two closed Riemann surfaces of genus at least 2 admit finite-degree covers that are geometrically close. Geometrically close means there exists a diffeomorphism between them with bounded distortion (small stretching). This conjecture was proven by Jeremy Kahn and Vladimir Markovic in 2012, making it a theorem. The theorem establishes a strong connection between any two such surfaces by showing their finite covers can be made arbitrarily close in their geometric properties.",
