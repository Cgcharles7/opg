  "summary": "The boolean Pythagorean triples problem asks if the set of natural numbers can be colored with two colors (e.g., red and blue) such that no Pythagorean triple (\\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\)) has all three numbers the same color. The problem was solved in 2016, proving that it is impossible to color the integers this way, as a partitioning is impossible beyond a certain number. The solution involved a 200-terabyte proof generated by a hybrid SAT solver, which was then verified using specialized algorithms.",
