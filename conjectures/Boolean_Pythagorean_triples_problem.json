  "rephrased": "Can the set of natural numbers be colored using two colors such that no Pythagorean triple (a² + b² = c²) has all three numbers the same color?",
  "implication_form": "If the set of positive integers is two-colored, then there exists a Pythagorean triple where all three numbers are the same color.",
  "posed_by": "Not specified in the provided text.",
  "solved_by": "Proven impossible by a team including Marijn Heule (and independently by another team) using a 200-terabyte proof verified by specialized algorithms.",
  "year_originated": "At least 60 years old (estimate based on the context of the 2016 solution).",
  "explained": "The Boolean Pythagorean triples problem is a conjecture that asks whether the set of positive integers can be partitioned into two subsets (or equivalently, colored with two colors) such that no Pythagorean triple (a set of three integers satisfying a² + b² = c²) is entirely contained within one subset or has all three elements the same color. This conjecture, which was proven to be false in 2016, established that such a two-coloring is impossible for sufficiently large integers, specifically beyond a certain finite threshold.",
