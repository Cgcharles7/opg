  "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakeya_set",
  "rephrased": "The smallest set that contains a straight line segment of length 1 in every possible direction must have positive measure (be 'thick') in all dimensions greater than 1.",
  "implication_form": "If a set contains a unit line segment in every direction, then it has positive Lebesgue measure.",

  "explained": "A Kakeya set, or Besicovitch set, is a set in Euclidean space that contains a unit line segment in every direction. A Kakeya needle set is a subset of a Kakeya set where a rigid needle can be rotated through all angles while remaining within the set. The Kakeya conjecture posits that the Hausdorff dimension of any Kakeya set in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is exactly \\(n\\). This means that while Kakeya sets can have Lebesgue measure zero (as shown by Besicovitch), they cannot be too 'thin' in terms of Hausdorff dimension.",
