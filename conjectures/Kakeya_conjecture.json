  "summary": "In mathematics, a Kakeya set, or Besicovitch set, is a set of points in Euclidean space which contains a unit line segment in every direction. For instance, a disk of radius 1/2 in the Euclidean plane, or a ball of radius 1/2 in three-dimensional space, forms a Kakeya set. Much of the research in this area has studied the problem of how small such sets can be. Abram Besicovitch showed that there are Besicovitch sets of measure zero.\nA Kakeya needle set (sometimes also known as a Kakeya set) is a",
