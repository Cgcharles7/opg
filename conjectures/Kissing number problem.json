  "summary": "In geometry, the kissing number of a mathematical space is defined as the greatest number of non-overlapping unit spheres that can be arranged in that space such that they each touch a common unit sphere.  For a given sphere packing (arrangement of spheres) in a given space, a kissing number can also be defined for each individual sphere as the number of spheres it touches.  For a lattice packing the kissing number is the same for every sphere, but for an arbitrary sphere packing the kissing num",
