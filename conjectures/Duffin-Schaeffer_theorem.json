  "rephrased": "A function f(q) allows almost all real numbers to be well approximated by rationals a/q (with gcd(a,q)=1) infinitely often if the series ∑ φ(q)f(q)/q diverges.",
  "implication_form": "If the series ∑_{q=1}^{∞} φ(q)f(q)/q diverges, then for almost all real numbers x, there are infinitely many integers q and a (with gcd(a,q)=1) such that |x - a/q| < f(q).",
