  "summary": "The Duffin–Schaeffer theorem is a result in number theory that provides a criterion for how well irrational numbers can be approximated by rational numbers with certain properties. It states that for a given function \\(f(q)\\), the inequality \\(|x-a/q|<f(q)\\) has infinitely many solutions for integers \\(a\\) and \\(q\\) with \\(\\gcd (a,q)=1\\) for almost all real numbers \\(x\\) if and only if the series \\(\\sum _{q=1}^{\\infty }\\frac{\\phi (q)f(q)}{q}\\) diverges. This theorem generalizes Khinchin's theorem, particularly for "wilder" sequences of denominators. It was originally a conjecture proposed by R. J. Duffin and A. C. Schaeffer in 1941 and was proven by Dimitris Koukoulopoulos and James Maynard in 2019. ",
